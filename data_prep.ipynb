potter half blood prince amazing rowling talented author breathes new light onto voldemort snape learn voldemort snape love story book definately nice addition serious atmosphere ron always comical relief really enjoyed seeing fred george shop great detail series think every reader definately waiting everything voldemort get complicated read book though interesting complicated good complicated though still understand everything world harry potter definately well thought loved book bought soon came read one day night luckily work next day soo upset dumbledore died like people knew reason snape killed accept snape traitor snape snape severus snape master potion harry okay find book filled different direction new spell help become favorite new potion teacher course hermione jealous ron usual mad self another adventure hogwarts prepared tear spoiler alert dumbledore death obvious amount time rowling took book humanize though snape half blood prince surprise thought would voldemort even though thought odd would proudly call half blood unknown fear look upon death darkness nothing find difficult give critical review series book ingrained young life read book would honestly today read book time book back year life always love harry friend love harry potter book bad idea read last part book feeling like seriously bad idea even know gonna happen read thing non stop finished lot filler killer ending half blood prince perfectly okay instalment harry potter series wake villainous lord voldemort return power year old harry return wizard school study voldemort past suspect peer plotting evil engages usual amount magical shenanigan first book voldemort evil intention open wizarding community actively bracing war harry understands role one capable defeating voldemort though harry story still confined boarding school book finally get sense really stake battle voldemort half blood prince includes decent amount school magic fun plenty humorous teen romance though book exactly driving complex plot apart couple isolated ineffective attack much menace behind antagonist plot tension come character hearing growing stream death disappearance via newspaper even half blood prince plot ought vital importance considering title turn relevant overall story nonetheless enjoyable harry deviously succeeds potion class following half blood prince handwritten instruction old textbook disturbing prince entices harry using dark curse another favourite sequence harry us luck potion convince one professor divulge shameful memory however like longer harry potter book fair amount padding padding come needle repetition example harry notice arch rival draco malfoy acting suspiciously dark art shop theorises draco become initiated one voldemort follower relay suspicion everyone listen many separate scene though one belief repetitive discussion add nothing new harry theory plot progression redundant thing happens harry suspect teacher professor snape aiding draco harry repeat suspicion multiple people separate scene convinces one generally waste reader time harry prolonged investigation draco malfoy activity composed endless failed attempt make harry look incredibly incompetent earlier book harry quite clever capable seems get progressively inept book ineptitude successfully stretch weak central plot required length expense transforming main character total ignoramus another source padding involves usual assortment subplots vary immensely interesting personally found quidditch subplot tiresome honestly wish rowling retired sport couple book ago rowling best make fresh different never fully succeeds mileage vary equally underwhelmed subplots like tonk deflated mood professor snape transfer potion classroom padding come rowling surrounding interesting moment much extraneous filler example dumbledore first take harry memory study voldemort past spend several page following completely random character bob ogden getting point actually ever really get point although mildly interesting memory show voldemort family unexpected light exactly contain super crucial information dumbledore could easily convey theory voldemort much succinctly instead drawing year via lengthy trip memory lane written final chapter book work wonderfully fantasy spectacle action scene final confrontation also advance series overall conflict change everything going final instalment incredibly frustrating harry dumbledore effort revealed nothing end day think half blood prince moderately enjoyable unfortunately overlong repetitive ultimately futile great series one like everyone else fell love admit sort problem plot hole limited character development like world enchanting captivating suck find care detail slow start book went vacation take think far saddest book time incredibly revealing wait read last one sobbing mess end one stop looking review read series seriously still read unlike earlier book series read many time used read waiting later book come first time revisited harry potter half blood prince since finished series different experience reading book know whole epic conflict voldemort work relatively unspoiled first reading time rumor major character died theory scrupulously avoided medium spoiler might lurk read whole book two day day release got enjoy experience surprise second time knowing coming strike book six actually bittersweet half blood prince dark brooding preceding book order phoenix dolores umbridge gone hogwarts bright happy place standardized testing wizard student behind harry friend seem enjoy class le pressured leisurely find time romance quidditch weekend hogsmeade learning apparate harry furious ignored dumbledore order phoenix back good term headmaster even singled special one one lesson aimed help defeat voldemort time come book six calm storm outside hogwarts terrible thing happening voldemort back daily prophet always full story kidnapping murder tragedy show dark lord gaining ground harry others aware misery insulated dark time every hogwarts refuge bubble dumbledore wizard voldemort fear dumbledore school safest place nowing harry last year hogwarts rather anticipated 7th year think kind lovely generally nice one got quidditch team captain finally potion teacher could stand gryffindor quidditch cup harry ginny got enjoy week happiness course idyllic calm last conclusion meant set final book deathly hallows cliffhanger traditional sense end half blood prince leaf lot open question relatively self contained plot book series knowing coming changed perspective ending first time read stunned horrified dumbledore death also snape apparent betrayal time approached final chapter strong sense inevitability random spoilery thought making way litchick epic harry potter group read going since thanksgiving thinking along snape horrible horrible remembered horrible big reveal end deathly hallows fall flat enough redeem nasty character still kind feel way retrospect think part half blood prince snape give harry saturday detention harry malfoy duel bit give away etention really lenient punishment almost murdering someone much suspicious time read book even attempt read review honestly going regret two year since read first time yes two year separated tte moment finished book started book ask know book particularly like well duh like book mean one favourite book reason plenty mention one tom riddle knew beginning series lord voldemort moment knew harry enemy one murdered parent certain curiosity know done know past born yet fully understand till book finally

arthur weasley dearest ambition figure airplane stay first book ever read twice read right got last book relative book book contain lot action rather wealth conversation human connection disconnection uncertainty importantly revelation certainly mean negative way halfway book knew gobbling exquisite plotting story many layer subterfuge distrust confusion sown throughout many coming head others beginning see light day saving final chapter series harry reader together learn many fascinating mysterious thing course book dearth action seem great burden lulled realm discovery understanding everything ultimately implodes one gripping astonishing unbelievable burst end wrote review book harry finally experienced consequence action entry progress even path adulthood learning always something surface protected right terribly wrong however still learned give credence hermione theory would saved trouble also discovers somewhat surprise despite lost still friend childhood decisively harry face uncertain future boldness bravery gryffindor love hate heart usually take little break harry potter book contemplate thing bit think able one goodness feel wait whole year ending overall liked lot previous installment enjoyed mostly slower pace seeing interaction dumbledore think title reveal prince identity ultimately bit anti climactic sure supposed red herring supposed think someone else well know book seemed rowling enjoy writing plot feel forced heavy also harry dad bully perfect sure discribed like anymore goodness definitely never read one first read book released 100 remember anything happened book feel intense one series far wait read last one feel like harry potter book know least well sure read many time read others feel like know story character involved way book maybe seen film many time fact think seen twice maybe book feel different book like onion much hurt quote shrek many layer peel back investigate like depth analysis make voldemort tick like finding past shaped situation well known character find like changing pace feel character really feel like coming age like old enough understand going might actually tool life experience battle everything going face thus begin disheartening beginning end hate admit never read book series released loss book outstanding intricacy plot admirable book also set seventh book perfectly continuing critical character story development much backstory missed sixth movie glad get book particularly voldemort history speaking book certainly keep line pattern series becoming progressively darker half blood prince reader thrust increasingly dismal tragic territory cry end think book may competing top slot ranking fully recognize point virtually everyone read series opinion review book intended add anything new discussion largely reference remember aspect book enjoyed reread dec 31st 2016 bumped star harry potter last harry potter book read half blood prince already seen movie skipped one tried reading deathly hallows remember whole lot movie aside final scene reading interesting experience see really interesting reading order phoenix noticed long book dragged plot lot filler often dodge main storyline tends dedicate entire chapter seemingly minor detail harry new annoying house elf examination new minister muggles ginny new love interest half blood prince seemingly minor role book even though book named seem main focus story focus main thing professor slughorn long forgotten memory voldemort malfoy secretive shenanigan identity mysterious half blood prince like said half blood prince feel rather unimportant particular two dilemma first one professor slughorn memory involves harry making several feeble attempt appeal latter dilemma seem ordinary throughout entire series malfoy always rather suspicious character casting villain bound happen sooner later however seeing malfoy actual villain make uncomfortable especially comparison voldemort malfoy come across obnoxious school bully minimal character development past six book rather big bad evil feared annoying sidekick get kicked around suppose overall main question main gripe book seemed entire book built twist ending two important point book voldemort secret dramatic ending building inevitable seems 600 page worth build largely uneeded side note snape character one interesting endeavor book tend get vague clue whether good evil book explores idea lot though tends gravitate towards evil much course already going last couple book anyways nothing terribly new though many disagree harry come mary sue case gary stu inherits sirius old possession gracefully want one building owned credited saving half ron family get attention plenty girl trying get slug club also happens dumbledore favorite student adept person potion class side note somebody reveal naming character first book seemed come cheap trick example malfoy mom named narcissa sound lot like narcissus fenrir greyback werewolf name allusion wolf god norse mythology another wolf lupin name sound strikingly similar lupus one scientific name dog seem bit cheap mean cool allude mythology real term many fenrir destined grow werewolf put better

repeat schedule ron hermione either get fight make amends thing mentioned half blood prince class another lesson dumbledore brief thing voldemort sometimes get occasional quidditch speaking played quidditch monday hyped ron hermione another intense confrontation conversation thing mentioned half blood prince either something slughorn brief mention hard class another lesson dumbledore sends harry brief state euphoria say brief mean brief people discus voldemort something major centering either voldemort ministry magic announced yes consider stan shunpike arrest major go reason rated star first really show well time war going show even wartime life continues really experienced tell book romance fred george popular wizard joke shop getting many customer even though powerful dark wizard

together heart stopping punch gut definitely end dumbledore died suspicion happening based comment read review hoping hope wrong happen come care much character series simply devastated upon reading demise actually put book aside minute could cry wise friendly yet powerful expect draco one kill tower based way already acting cry earlier bathroom also think snape would one obviously always

everything magical first fantasy series trilogy though literally inhaled book first time enjoyed much better second time past summer swear read ending first time time like reading first time finished reading book half day still favourite harry potter book far perfect balance action information time true masterpiece literature another great harry potter book felt really really awful dumbledore died someone knew real life really pas gotten attached old coot also felt little bit hopelessness thought lost dumbledore passed away thank goodness harry although little helpless first book gave strength believe harry belief really could defeat dark lord one hard get started really slow ending like bam last hundred page curled ball holding breath read worth slow start going review series since awhile since read know deathly hollow far favorite series start slow relatively innocent really pick pace around book prisoner azkaban writing spot never lulling reader detail ridden coma instead begging read late night book well written enjoyable perfect read really good loved love book though lol eally neat finally learn professor snape though liked find awesome potion love story took turn one played story well full information dying finish book favorite book whole series book roller coaster ride emotion drama mystery tragedy potterhead best book rowling date hey ginny weasley actual personality spoiler alert loved book one favorite book really hate part dumbledore dy though sad fact horxrux even real though dumbledore died even sad cried hard book letdown order phoenix happy realize really enjoying writing mystery edition detailing year hogwarts harry spell class run new recipe book old book lying around closet book previously owned somebody named prince prince added many note brewing spell whenever harry followed additional instruction concoction always succeeded half blood prince many theory including harry mother wrong fooled one good choice make sense world revealed good liked book way end thing really started fall apart dumbledore drinking lagoon water made dipsy made sense seemed completely character find key destroying voldermort clue another person voldermort initial little late series introducing new mystery character like yet another major character killed felt shock value anything else seemed meaningless disturbing harry quits school kind message child frustrating last couple chapter stephen king say miracle harry potter series keep getting better genius rowling decision probably never even seriously considered time follow harry schooling result harry fan never left behind question whether rowling bound life arthur conan doyle bound sherlock holmes recommended audiobook loved read twice even begin describe thought installment book hogwarts charm earlier book absolutely amazing character grown much become wonderful people genuinely care harry especially really tell grew book le arrogant control temper somewhat decide character favorite though awesome fun hate ending killed though okay awe rowling created magical world never get boring seen movie yet still shocked hurt happy every chapter movie ending book justice except wand scene movie rowling really know write every book get fascinating turn page favorite part scene harry learned voldemort past interesting cannot believe almost know harry potter fan dealt sure get last book cannot believe one book left harry potter fan deal longer though get get fuss pick favorite book series wow reread fueled watching movie reading quality fic heard book read yet want anything spoiled read beyond cut say read first five book course going get around reading eventually finish half blood prince eagerly await publication seventh book series grad school kept finishing sure probably one read yet anyway since gotten writing review general reason really anywhere near biggest buff going get debate whether dumbledore really dead world snape never known anyone acurately predict thing mind little idle speculation going devote serious energy figuring something rowling inevitably explain much creatively entertainingly could two thing loved series think half blood prince continued rowling continued fulfill promise making sure style book mature harry ayear older wiser moody teenager order phoenix harry realizes important thing getting pissed world still year old boy though surprising get frustrated dumbledore telling everything right away glad see calmed little bit even dealing intricate plot detail maybe rowling still manages craft great mystery leading one way end showing really something completely different example talk werewolf draco mysterious disappearance sickly appearance convinced draco become werewolf made feel pretty stupid truth revealed love still able trick five book getting used writing style two thing liked half blood prince specifically love whole horcrux thing satisfying finally know voldemort defeated reader little satisfied ultimate mystery series kill voldemort time read seventh book find harry actually able defeat information harry potter finally get girlfriend ginny way cooler cho good see chosen one hooking someone talented clearly side starting feel like rowling forgetting raging teenage hormone also nice focus ron hermione seemingly never ending dance around getting romantically involved plus snogging among coolest british slang ever approve many excuse use book two thing le excited half blood prince harry breaking ginny end book tough take besides already target ron little sister already seen besides exactly hiding relationship even took harry forever get around snogging someone draco malfoy could easily inform voldemort ginny even dearer place harry heart even broken harry returning hogwarts way book structured importance hogwarts voldemort make clear hogwarts still figure seventh book harry planning student anymore trouble getting head around concept snape killing dumbledore touching foot pole since behind time know everyone else talked book death feel unmotivated get detail part uber popular series also make book hard review sorry lesser quality review full review personal website post excerpt though star worst thing book dumbledore died love draco kill snape heart wrenching best thing book draco malfoy say sucker blond bad boy able kill dumbledore think scared whole scene actually pretty intense snape poor severus kill real friend cry review book pretty pointless regardless everyone know phenomenal series harry potter book beyond expectation still doubt reading series

remember really except big huge thing happened book even fiction like dementors surrounding something like never feel happiness rowling amazing talent evoke reader immersed story cry like 5th book feel never happy like one also feel like book book feel like whole book meeting voldemort end book fighting like rest book book spent many plot question ended pretty swiftly last chapter gave star instead think harry potter series escaped vision big control first time got half blood prince interest waned quite bit returning summer could recall broad stroke slughorn dumbledore betrayal people behind fact learned lot tom riddle backstory thus went mostly open mind though mistrust lot rowling attitude towards world really liked layer corruption ministry revealed horrifying entire governmental system world giant miscarriage justice add depth story order phoenix lot narrative arc fact magic implicitly support prejudice condescending attitude towards people creature different level kind magic even good guy pro muggle know draco ordered kill dumbledore see fingerprint sinister element book see honestly terrified darkness enacting even keep coming plan always love learning tom riddle backstory really book drama romance present day filler support infodumping finding went hogwarts killed really really cool harry dumbledore talked merope gaunt awful defending use love potion coerce tom marry certainly agree abandoned released magic talking conversation go merope refused raise wand even save life even stay alive son choice like mother greatly weakened long suffering never mother courage excuse first witch die world like selfish plot become homeless die childbirth deal baby ugh moving love idea prophecy impact voldemort believed deeply acted harry responded kind love idea worked harry pure heart would want bloody vicious revenge even heard prophecy first logic fail second literal next chapter almost kill draco malfoy bathroom lol guess purehearted actually idea love magic wizarding bond work inconsistent pretty disgusting related note harry monster chest ginny terrible writing little annoyed three major plot point happen night namely umbledore locates cave locket horcrux alfoy fix vanishing cabinet relawney reveals snape spy passed half prophecy understand storytelling perspective force harry choose one revelation pursue tangentially related seems
