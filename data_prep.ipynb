Every moment, every breath, contains a choice. ut life is imperfect. e make the wrong choices. o we end up living in a state of perpetual regret, and is there anything worse?  built something that could actually eradicate regret. et you find worlds where you made the right choice.\" aniela says, \"Life doesn\\'t work that way. ou live with your choices and learn. ou don\\'t cheat the system.\"'"

       "'a fun, fast paced science fiction thriller. i read it in 2 nights and couldn\\'t put it down. the book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches, and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world. and in this book, someone invents a way to switch between these worlds. this was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote: \"i think about all the choices we\\'ve made that created this moment. us sitting here together at this beautiful table. then i think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening, and it all feels, i don\\'t know...\" \"what?\" so fragile. now he becomes thoughtful for a moment. he says finally, \"it\\'s terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world.\" his book can\\'t be discussed without spoilers. t is a book about choice and regret. ver regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career? ell jason2 made that choice and then did regret it. learly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness - to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life. \\'m being snarky because while there is certainly something to that, you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within.  thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension. n fact, all the characters were fairly shallow. aniela was the perfect wife. yan the perfect antithesis of jason. manda the perfect loyal traveling companion, etc. his, plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off - but i\\'d still read it again if i could go back in time - was a very fun and engaging read. f you want to really minimize regret, you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place. egret can\\'t be hacked, which is kind of the point of the book. y favorite book about regret is remains of the day.  do really like the visualization of the decision tree though - that is a powerful concept. every moment, every breath, contains a choice. ut life is imperfect. e make the wrong choices. o we end up living in a state of perpetual regret, and is there anything worse?  built something that could actually eradicate regret. et you find worlds where you made the right choice.\" aniela says, \"life doesn\\'t work that way. ou live with your choices and learn. ou don\\'t cheat the system.\"'"

though still understand everything world harry potter definately well thought loved book bought soon came read one day night luckily work next day soo upset dumbledore died like people knew reason snape killed accept snape traitor snape snape severus snape master potion harry okay find book filled different direction new spell help become favorite new potion teacher course hermione jealous ron usual mad self another adventure hogwarts prepared tear spoiler alert dumbledore death obvious amount time rowling took book humanize though snape half blood prince surprise thought would voldemort even though thought odd would proudly call half blood unknown fear look upon death darkness nothing find difficult give critical review series book ingrained young life read book would honestly today read book time book back year life always love harry friend love harry potter book bad idea read last part book feeling like seriously bad idea even know gonna happen read thing non stop finished lot filler killer ending half blood prince perfectly okay instalment harry potter series wake villainous lord voldemort return power year old harry return wizard school study voldemort past suspect peer plotting evil engages usual amount magical shenanigan first book voldemort evil intention open wizarding community actively bracing war harry understands role one capable defeating voldemort though harry story still confined boarding school book finally get sense really stake battle voldemort half blood prince includes decent amount school magic fun plenty humorous teen romance though book exactly driving complex plot apart couple isolated ineffective attack much menace behind antagonist plot tension come character hearing growing stream death disappearance via newspaper even half blood prince plot ought vital importance considering title turn relevant overall story nonetheless enjoyable harry deviously succeeds potion class following half blood prince handwritten instruction old textbook disturbing prince entices harry using dark curse another favourite sequence harry us luck potion convince one professor divulge shameful memory however like longer harry potter book fair amount padding padding come needle repetition example harry notice arch rival draco malfoy acting suspiciously dark art shop theorises draco become initiated one voldemort follower relay suspicion everyone listen many separate scene though one belief repetitive discussion add nothing new harry theory plot progression redundant thing happens harry suspect teacher professor snape aiding draco harry repeat suspicion multiple people separate scene convinces one generally waste reader time harry prolonged investigation draco malfoy activity composed endless failed attempt make harry look incredibly incompetent earlier book harry quite clever capable seems get progressively inept book ineptitude successfully stretch weak central plot required length expense transforming main character total ignoramus another source padding involves usual assortment subplots vary immensely interesting personally found quidditch subplot tiresome honestly wish rowling retired sport couple book ago rowling best make fresh different never fully succeeds mileage vary equally underwhelmed subplots like tonk deflated mood professor snape transfer potion classroom padding come rowling surrounding interesting moment much extraneous filler example dumbledore first take harry memory study voldemort past spend several page following completely random character bob ogden getting point actually ever really get point although mildly interesting memory show voldemort family unexpected light exactly contain super crucial information dumbledore could easily convey theory voldemort much succinctly instead drawing year via lengthy trip memory lane written final chapter book work wonderfully fantasy spectacle action scene final confrontation also advance series overall conflict change everything going final instalment incredibly frustrating harry dumbledore effort revealed nothing end day think half blood prince moderately enjoyable unfortunately overlong repetitive ultimately futile great series one like everyone else fell love admit sort problem plot hole limited character development like world enchanting captivating suck find care detail slow start book went vacation take think far saddest book time incredibly revealing wait read last one sobbing mess end one stop looking review read series seriously still read unlike earlier book series read many time used read waiting later book come first time revisited harry potter half blood prince since finished series different experience reading book know whole epic conflict voldemort work relatively unspoiled first reading time rumor major character died theory scrupulously avoided medium spoiler might lurk read whole book two day day release got enjoy experience surprise second time knowing coming strike book six actually bittersweet half blood prince dark brooding preceding book order phoenix dolores umbridge gone hogwarts bright happy place standardized testing wizard student behind harry friend seem enjoy class le

harry others aware misery insulated dark time every hogwarts refuge bubble dumbledore wizard voldemort fear dumbledore school safest place nowing harry last year hogwarts rather anticipated 7th year think kind lovely generally nice one got quidditch team captain finally potion teacher could stand gryffindor quidditch cup harry ginny got enjoy week happiness course idyllic calm last conclusion meant set final book deathly hallows cliffhanger traditional sense end half blood prince leaf lot open question relatively self contained plot book series knowing coming changed perspective ending first time read stunned horrified dumbledore death also snape apparent betrayal time approached final chapter strong sense inevitability random spoilery thought making way litchick epic harry potter group read going since thanksgiving thinking along snape horrible horrible remembered horrible big reveal end deathly hallows fall flat enough redeem nasty character still kind feel way retrospect think part half blood prince snape give harry saturday detention harry malfoy duel bit give away etention really lenient punishment almost murdering someone much suspicious time read book even attempt read review honestly going regret two year since read first time yes two year separated tte moment finished book started book ask know book particularly like well duh like book mean one favourite book reason plenty mention one tom riddle knew beginning series lord voldemort moment knew harry enemy one murdered parent certain curiosity know done know past born yet fully understand till book finally

finally rowling expanding wizarding world much focused using develop character ron still annoying ever one thing never change least something bad happens could laugh malfoy snape left background book know going month time simply tiresome mysterious situation continuously brought harry questioning mind resolution end although suppose put climax somewhere lot dialogue toward end felt contrived rowling suddenly get lot information stuck anyone mouth least dumbledore death made large amount annoyance made tragic meaningful death main character good book complete without killing least one person important liked one best far voldemort actually becomes realistic villain past motive get plot speak longer scary mysterious force shadowy background finally dumbledore actually talk harry specifically going voldemort finally question answered get six book reach harry still obnoxious ever one hindsight really going snape dumbledore show much dunce even dumbledore seems foolish ignorant

obviously much love rest people world simply dating maybe overwhelming emotion caused simply say want read together know wanting finish sixth yet another reason caused realize yes need minor panic attack whether man right accepts fact twenty one year old still reading harry potter remember exact place sitting read dumbledore death scene first time remember second first time sitting edge bed broke tear partially late night partially course dumbledore freaking died second time sitting bed next reading novel monk kidnapping reading malfoy internal conflict good versus evil first time read

possible reading mean like everything happened book really write anything else risk spoiling fun case torture anybody still read series rest spoiler tag know said last review wanted see dumbledore really happy book much really great moment harry hated died character rowling could killed one least wanted see die might odd death emotional impact think either ron hermione would one got killed hand dumbledore death take completely surprise niggling worry since early book doomed die end even really explain aybe character type kindly wise elderly mentor often seem fare well fictional story kept hoping wrong thought would happen last book happened though kind see point book sake harry character growth since main character force one making big decision arry dumbledore wisdom fall back even ignore way often safety rescue often provided thing add though always waffling snape loyalty hard consider somebody one good guy hold onto anger steadfastly treat people prejudice laming harry father behavior unfair irrational really working voldemort seemed like often put petty interest ahead good cause never 100 sure evil acted misguided hateful person still genuinely working voldemort behavior big act make certain voldemort would believe still working even usually swung toward one last two explanation dumbledore trusted imagine dumbledore wrong know infallible figured really really good reason trusting snape arry believed dumbledore bamboozled snape apparent regret leading death harry parent snape hated begin hat make sense dumbledore definitely fool wise enough cautious tom riddle would le cautious snape undeniably serving voldemort seems like dumbledore belief snape could trusted also thought weird dumbledore said please snape right end asking kill hat harry interpreted anyway dumbledore really realized point snape really side still think would done anything remotely like beg life seemed wrong completely character help hope sort trick going sort elaborate ruse thing really appear know really unlikely though know harry apparently became unfrozen paralysis moment dumbledore died phoenix fawkes began mourning shortly death also character saw dead body saw snape agree unbreakable promise would help malfoy accomplish objective malfoy made pretty clear kill dumbledore hand snape really voldemort side surely would told dumbledore plot would time come something probably overthinking want dumbledore die moving quite bit teenage romance angst book ore wanted although least harry cho thing seems well like cho inny least likeable hermione ron thing got little annoying though mind relationship developing two obvious coming early immature way handled got tiresome know teenager behavior abnormal still really want read wanted throw kindle across room every

anything new discussion largely reference remember aspect book enjoyed reread dec 31st 2016 bumped star harry potter last harry potter book read half blood prince already seen movie skipped one tried reading deathly hallows remember whole lot movie aside final scene reading interesting experience see really interesting reading order phoenix noticed long book dragged plot lot filler often dodge main storyline tends dedicate entire chapter seemingly minor detail harry new annoying house elf examination new minister muggles ginny new love interest half blood prince seemingly minor role book even though book named seem main focus story focus main thing professor slughorn long forgotten memory voldemort malfoy secretive shenanigan identity mysterious half blood prince like said half blood prince feel rather unimportant particular two dilemma first one professor slughorn memory involves harry making several feeble attempt appeal latter dilemma seem ordinary throughout entire series malfoy always rather suspicious character casting villain bound happen sooner later however seeing malfoy actual villain make uncomfortable especially comparison voldemort malfoy come across obnoxious school bully minimal character development past six book rather big bad evil feared annoying sidekick get kicked around suppose overall main question main gripe book seemed entire book built twist ending two important point book voldemort secret dramatic ending building inevitable seems 600 page worth build largely uneeded side note snape character one interesting endeavor book tend get vague clue whether good evil book explores idea lot though tends gravitate towards evil much course already going last couple book anyways nothing terribly new though many disagree harry come mary sue case gary stu inherits sirius old possession gracefully want one building owned credited saving half ron family get attention plenty girl trying get slug club also happens dumbledore favorite student adept person potion class side note somebody reveal naming character first book seemed come cheap trick example malfoy mom named narcissa sound lot like narcissus fenrir greyback werewolf name allusion wolf god norse mythology another wolf lupin name sound strikingly similar lupus one scientific name dog seem bit cheap mean cool allude mythology real term many fenrir destined grow werewolf put better term reminds cruella deville 101 dalmatian whose name clearly meant resemble cruel devil account evil anyways much like order phoenix book tends drag bit really last ending chapter rewarding help set dramatic stage final book deathly hallows give interesting insight voldemort history feature one dramatic moment harry potter history spite everythingb spite dark twisting path saw stretching ahead

major issue book one bit rinse repeat schedule everybody know harry potter go supposed unexpected supposed know going come next two character starting grate nerve like seriously ron hermione keep shifting back forth first fine hate much make purposeful move even look suddenly fine get teenage relationship back forth lot seriously ron annoying sorry seriously want punch face hand dumbledore favorite character book well aware rowling probably building angst happens later still well developed character book character rarely ever irritated thank also book boring previously stated rinse repeat schedule ron hermione either get fight make amends thing mentioned half blood prince class another lesson dumbledore brief thing voldemort sometimes get occasional quidditch speaking played quidditch monday hyped ron hermione another intense confrontation conversation thing mentioned half blood prince either something slughorn brief mention hard class another lesson dumbledore sends harry brief state euphoria say brief mean brief people discus voldemort something major centering either voldemort ministry magic announced yes consider stan shunpike arrest major go reason rated star first really show well time war going show even wartime life continues really experienced tell book romance fred george popular wizard joke shop getting many customer even though powerful dark wizard time back ala still wish discussed order phoenix mean come last book named guess everything bad favorite character order phoenix also found ending incredible powered right ending wonderfully written way tugged heartstrings pretty decent book suppose however bit sour taste mouth really gave star due reverie previous book become better upon reread still think much teen drama romance bogged novel narcissa snape reason rate book highly definitely appreciate narcissa hindsight well draco cover pensieve sad yet brilliant pacing perfect plot great character amazing way aside obviously umbridge even though appeared two sentence book rowling genius really say right little scared start final book knowing come time wait little torn knowing starting next book tonight anyway tomorrow earliest merlin beard book definitely know many people say rowling living legend really know stuff warning spoiler present review easier immediately get central story one mainly harry stopped moody order phoenix made like sixth installment series think half blood prince might favorite one far behind prisoner azkaban really say something kept immersed stay late finish say others posse quality even felt could fact enjoyed subplots normally like lot memory flashback book rowling unfolds everything skillfully always learning voldemort past quite interesting suppose bad childhood could contributed evilness overall think crazy also answered something puzzling since beginning goblet fire get three riddle murdered big house explanation midway novel made sense learned flo come harry potter book knowing eventually question ask always felt like harry right keep close eye draco throughout sixth year hogwarts especially everything heard train found little odd ron hermione dismissed harry serious suspicion draco easily evidence steadily kept piling surprised turn character took honestly always pest yes definitely worthy enemy harry ever since first book still sad started working death eater end number six felt really bad probably felt like choice whole family voldemort side excuse action though curious see become last one honestly say book best secondary character series ever read quite statement coming like think read lot almost made kind impression whether good bad example kind love luna even though around whole lot introduced last book may little odd open way stating thing really hoping kind happy ending weasleys always special place heart however kind surprised harry feeling ginny seemed spring suddenly mean known five year realizes pretty awesome got used kind wish relationship little development really disappointed first ginny really quiet close flat character get book actually showed personality much fiery annoyed harry broke end obvious voldemort would use whoever harry cared could easily use ron hermione see ditching book movie seen tiny hint feeling ron hermione think came lot one obvious hermione temper tantrum bird ron got together lavender extremely annoying one hand felt kind bad gotten point really frustrated dance around feeling thing think pretty cute together though wonder sometimes made rowling decide put two main character together heart stopping punch gut definitely end dumbledore died suspicion happening based comment read review hoping hope wrong happen come care much character series simply devastated upon reading demise actually put book aside minute could cry wise friendly yet powerful expect draco one kill tower based way already acting cry earlier bathroom also think snape would one obviously always disliked behavior towards harry hoping really changed though maybe part thought even though five year gone without murdering harry fact snape half blood prince probably seen coming advice gave coming potion book really still feel like completely understand snape character hate killing dumbledore book excellent set final chapter though want put reading last one know see end immediately really annoyed dumbledore one gosh many damn emotion book learn voldemort capable living going much horcruxs contain small fragment voldemorts soul must destroy horcruxs order destroy voldemort battle

reading book half day still favourite harry potter book far perfect balance action information time true masterpiece literature another great harry potter book felt really really awful dumbledore died someone knew real life really pas gotten attached old coot also felt little bit hopelessness thought lost dumbledore passed away thank goodness harry although little helpless first book gave strength believe harry belief really could defeat dark lord one hard get started really slow ending like bam last hundred page curled ball holding breath read worth slow start going review series since awhile since read know deathly hollow far favorite series start slow relatively innocent really pick pace around book prisoner azkaban writing spot never lulling reader detail ridden coma instead begging read late night book well written enjoyable perfect read really good loved love book though lol eally neat finally learn professor snape though liked find awesome potion love story took turn one

realize really enjoying writing mystery edition detailing year hogwarts harry spell class run new recipe book old book lying around closet book previously owned somebody named prince prince added many note brewing spell whenever harry followed additional instruction concoction always succeeded half blood prince many theory including harry mother wrong fooled one good choice make sense world revealed good liked book way end thing really started fall apart dumbledore drinking lagoon water made dipsy made sense seemed completely character find key destroying voldermort clue another person voldermort initial little late series introducing new mystery character like yet another major character killed felt shock value anything else seemed meaningless disturbing harry quits school kind message child frustrating last couple chapter stephen king say miracle harry potter series keep getting better genius rowling decision probably never even seriously considered time follow harry schooling result harry fan never left behind question whether rowling bound life arthur conan doyle bound sherlock holmes recommended audiobook loved read twice even begin describe thought installment book hogwarts charm earlier book absolutely amazing character grown much become wonderful people genuinely care harry especially really tell grew book le arrogant control temper somewhat decide character favorite though awesome fun hate ending killed though okay awe rowling created magical world never get boring seen movie yet still shocked hurt happy every chapter movie ending book justice

sure probably one read yet anyway since gotten writing review general reason really anywhere near biggest buff going get debate whether dumbledore really dead world snape never known anyone acurately predict thing mind little idle speculation going devote serious energy figuring something rowling inevitably explain much creatively entertainingly could two thing loved series think half blood prince continued rowling continued fulfill promise making sure style book mature harry ayear older wiser moody teenager order phoenix harry realizes important thing getting pissed world still year old boy though surprising get frustrated dumbledore telling everything right away glad see calmed little bit even dealing intricate plot detail maybe rowling still manages craft great mystery leading one way end showing really something completely different example talk werewolf draco mysterious disappearance sickly appearance convinced draco become werewolf made feel pretty stupid truth revealed love still able trick five book getting used writing style two thing liked half blood prince specifically love whole horcrux thing satisfying finally know voldemort defeated reader little satisfied ultimate mystery series kill voldemort time read seventh book find harry actually able defeat information harry potter finally get girlfriend ginny way cooler cho good see chosen one hooking someone talented clearly side starting feel like rowling forgetting raging teenage hormone also nice focus ron hermione seemingly never ending dance around getting romantically involved plus snogging among coolest british slang ever approve many excuse use book two thing le excited half blood prince harry breaking ginny end book tough take besides already target ron little sister already seen besides exactly hiding relationship even took harry forever get around snogging someone draco malfoy could easily inform voldemort ginny even dearer place harry heart even broken harry returning hogwarts way

hilarious truly best faced death also like get short harry one finally act like expect le patient time seriously anyone read immediately go deathly hallows see dislike dumbledore long break maybe love characterization brought lump throat every time someone mentioned sirius harry review month due conflicting schedule note already read two year ago remembered check go thing like book dumbledore death yes finally breaking read two day possibly even one day sure acquired ariel former bookseller new paltz release party lovely reread first time since watching rewatching movie two thing better movie rest better book although movie make nice condensed version wish shown dumbledore funeral dialogue harry dumbledore drinking potion cave much better book dunno please movie thought people knew dialogue anyway lot reveal end could perhaps shown point good story wonderful character rowling inventive much much one best book ever read revealing much first person movie one treat written story understand bit better single minded harry rowling characterisation amazing many character revel following adventure half blood prince especially loved budding romance harry ginny magnificent character seen movie like long time suggest sitting night charming modern classic work fantasy harry almost lost everything ever loved still grieving sirius remains mostly like harry mostly deal problem shoulder age sense normalcy book depended upon harry potter always favorite book series half blood prince especially loved snape favorite character book loved learning bit past read book fast get way could finish series honest least favourite installment read young appreciate conversation telling historical story history certain character even looking back series though favourite possible skip understand final book would probably second favorite series love development ginny weasley central character part wish spin last year hogwarts reader thought get darker quite thing like book book poorly written many bad thing happen character plotting still good riter thought dumbledore die course mentor character stay throughout entire hero journey arry become hero dumbledore always suppose dumbledore could incapacitated another way next book would saving dumbledore rather stopping voldemort aybe voldemort could kidnapped dumbledore kept coma stasis way aybe gloat ind like han solo carbonite freezing happier problem amazing long take read book half size book blow matter hour swear first two time read book like much third time couple scene harry dumbledore choked time thoroughly embarrassed systematically losing shit every chapter still lot problem book sometimes harry little snotty palatable plot get weak point harry potter book inherent insatiable charm always hit right feel feel like soul got trampled cried much since augustus water happened romance subplots still hate sorry might favorite book series love backstory tom riddle learning horcruxes pretty much say know emotionally prepared read deathly hallows aaah harry potter amazing rowling wrong spoiler alert tend think volume interesting almost quirky point harry potter series continues dark tone set order phoenix punctuated near death macabre happening brutal loss beloved character also effectively serf first part series conclusion pivotal much foreshadowed war force good evil well underway however unlike book directly much half blood prince hearkens back first book focusing largely daily happening school rowling continues much action impact story climax happen drawing room take issue found interesting effective way ensuring story told primarily harry point view surprise also reader surprise handled better fashion favorite volume goblet fire end book made behind scene action noticeable half blood prince unfolds gradually periodic acknowledgment side shadowy action conclusive final gambit book also echo exposition heavy feeling order phoenix le kind reviewer pointed large portion book dedicated dumbledore showing harry bit piece voldemort past first reading standalone book make somewhat slow meandering plot feel make sense context entire series fourth book introduced grim direction story second half fifth book gave insight good guy one give insight bad guy reader ready conclusion much enjoyed peek voldemort backstory helped make sense character rather dismissing evil evil sake also note reflection harry predicament previous book whereas determined knew proven unfortunately incorrect time instinct correct beginning nobody listen instance prove dire consequence least harry irritating teenaged sulking yelling admit authentic character standpoint even bug hell refreshing part half blood prince however return charm levity hogwarts even sinister undercurrent action book take place class serious business main story broken quidditch classwork young romance feel like final acknowledgement relatively benign setting introduced first harry potter book instills mixture nostalgia wonder book furthermore make event book main story jarring emotional occur around light hearted magic everyday teenaged conundrum hogwarts culminate direct assault within school course discussion book would incomplete without covering spoiler death dumbledore fall neatly within confines version monomyth rowling heretofore created dumbledore gone harry loses mentor last confidant therefore prepared going get venture forth defeat villain immediately set last chapter dumbledore given rowling usual abrupt death scene also given touching remembrance character reaction elaborate funeral serf setting harry next decision impact death immediately profoundly felt character reader especially considering much time spent book endearing reader dumbledore always whimsical comforting character even aura power authority half blood prince establishes benevolence point laying little thick nevertheless death leaf palpable feeling uncertainty harry prepares face voldemort kill killed setting right epic tone end book beginning final volume found liked book much second time read like order phoenix character fully realized point react situation realistic way half blood prince strike interesting balance fantastic macabre perfect story standpoint fine job maintaining overall story arc rhythm book also connects loose end throwaway moment previous book brilliant character story setpieces revealing rowling penchant grand design planning ahead unapologetic harry potter fan like half blood prince serf examination series interesting character severus snape first foremost among reread finale spoiler alert always felt book shit get real keep rowling habit upping ante older character reader growing character get fantastically well written enjoyable remember get full detail deathly hallows snape betrayal going pissed revisit one watching movie first time movie based book damn old fool give harry great instinct fighting belief best friend putting hero complexion mean want take world got prepare waterworks next book rereading book wonderful still tied favourite book despite end last book take place normality like yet harry friend older stake higher thus far also great mystery winding way storyline keep interesting entire time really need harry potter world orlando dare youuuuuu killl dumbledoreeeeee cannot dieeeeeeeeeee aefaopihdf asdha ldjn sand alsnd powerful good wizard goddemittttttttqrnao hraojsdajsd god believe rowling killed dumbledore believe hat absurd thing ever wonder much dumbledore book thought weird around ever heir meetups also show patient dumbledore good wizard kill mad severus snape pleading umbledore pleading please severus avadakadavra dare dare need find snape kill please rgh mad hen read refused believe thought dumbledore trick sleeve like maybe clone anything finally hit character died harry said end right alone without adult parent figure stand voldemort face alone nitially thought book kinda fallback order pheonix ending take mean book kinda slow focus mundane thing much even harry hat suspicion towards malfoy seems childish sometimes love story half blood prince book private lesson dumbledore etc like said ending take really like harry got together ginny like sort happen right way totally break ending though think get together soon final book final book already ready leave world edit almost hour still mad snape right believe dumbledore died like hand person trusted nonetheless uch treason nape ever forgiven matter remorseful even dumbledore died still believing good people still trust snape even last straw must know watch movie think watched first final one never really pay attention spoiler co always try avoid one much dumbledore death came real shock year late lol movie god dull justice book book full feeling time movie lack ntil end book harry still full anger fury movie harry go like wow believe beautiful like dumbledore funeral ginny made first move movie really like harry kiss ginny first heat moment well still good listening audio book double speed get tome like much faster liked one lot great finally know background shall named furious dumbledore trusting snape retarded hard tell still working voldemort ever since first book still hoping harry get hot hermione care think book damn good spoiler alert horribly disappointed harry potter order phoenix took year read book book back form harry moody whiny teenager plot fast engaging really enjoyed back story voldemort little disappointed snape malfoy behaved exactly set behave series hoped might redeeming moment may yet kind like reading murder mystery find red herring really spoiler believe character die series still convinced sirius gone guess believe dumbledore really die lack emotional punch think wizard able wave wand mutter curse save anyway wait get hand book see end bad got wait read mockingjay vote class second last harry potter saga great great loss word describe unbelievable amazing book reading series ten year last reading finding wonderful wait begin move forward final one adore character beautiful writing style story twist definitely child book simply put great book like said point best thing series really think one best book ever read certainly worth reading recommending one time best book know snape reason everything find 7th book betrayal hit hard every time owever make happy allow draco kill dumbledore entire book dark feel like darkest book remember reading first time grasping however got older read also movie came helped understood subject matter better enjoyed story better lead grand finale harry potter series rowling ratchet tension another strong installment harry potter half blood prince deviate little formula beginning ending come expect series rowling also keep reader guessing snape true loyalty hile dumbledore death along harry decision return hogwarts instead pursue voldemort raise stake considerably bottom line rowling continues deliver new character intricate web subplots continued development core character surprise along way spoiler alert enjoyed 6th entry series much book particularly like rowling give reader taste lord voldemort backstory found fascinating see went angry orphan penchant stealing hurting others sinister adult hidden agenda book easily serf bridge harry timeline tom riddle became voldemort issue story even though snape suspect harry half blood prince potion book never pursues prof harry hide within room requirement considering idea half blood prince title figured resolve really see happened book coming beginning end loved amazing finally learn snape left doubting everything thought story general glad read seventh already otherwise may died anticipation best book series one favorite movie well expected think book added lot depth story movie maybe lacking bit even though movie entertaining especially concerning dumbledore death need marked spoiler anymore come know voldemort past everything made sense book therefore tension palpable loved develop romantic relationship book make feel lot young adulty like ron hermione also book ginny much awesome movie ginny true five star read greg nov 2005 reread june 2016 still star make review short harry potter half blood prince started conversation minsiter magic prime minister muggle world really loved part hilarious haha ended breathless moment history harry
