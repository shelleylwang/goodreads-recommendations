       "'A fun, fast paced science fiction thriller. I read it in 2 nights and couldn\\'t put it down. The book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches, and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world. And in this book, someone invents a way to switch between these worlds. This was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote: \"I think about all the choices we\\'ve made that created this moment. Us sitting here together at this beautiful table. Then I think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening, and it all feels, I don\\'t know...\" \"What?\" So fragile. Now he becomes thoughtful for a moment. He says finally, \"It\\'s terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world.\" his book can\\'t be discussed without spoilers. t is a book about choice and regret. ver regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career? ell Jason2 made that choice and then did regret it. learly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness - to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life. \\'m being snarky because while there is certainly something to that, you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within.  thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension. n fact, all the characters were fairly shallow. aniela was the perfect wife. yan the perfect antithesis of Jason. manda the perfect loyal traveling companion, etc. his, plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off - but I\\'d still read it again if I could go back in time - was a very fun and engaging read. f you want to really minimize regret, you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place. egret can\\'t be hacked, which is kind of the point of the book. y favorite book about regret is Remains of the Day.  do really like the visualization of the decision tree though - that is a powerful concept.

       "'One of the best books in the series I think. It only gets better as the suspense builds in this terrific, mysterious tale of possible double-crossing and virtuousness that delivers the best emotional mix of good versus evil on both a meta- and micro- scale since the Allies versus the Axis in the Second World War. First of all, Im in love with these books since I was 12 years old, and I got my first book for Christmas. I was hooked then, and I am still now, several years, books, movies and theme parks later. Once piece of me will always dream about this magical world, and Hogwarts will always be my home. Having said that, this is my least favorite book. I enjoyed learning about Voldemort\\'s past, but it took way too much of the book and the school year and it wasn\\'t that much worth it. The other characters, Ron and Hermione, are flat and lack of any flavor; they just leave Harry alone and submerge themselves in a teen world filled of hormones. I really didn\\'t like how they suddenly, form one book to another, are so superficial and blind, and cant care less about Harry and Voldemort. To me it just doesn\\'t make any sense. I cried a lot at the end of this book. I know this had to happen, but it still huts when I think about it. But I knew the true from the beginning, I knew it couldn\\'t be as Rowling was showing us and who was actually an allied in disguise. If you are expecting a book full of action, this is definitively not it. But this need to happen in order to give room to the final book, the one that changes everything. I just hoped it could have been more fun to read. This book didn\\'t disappoint me at all. I absolutely love the charming aspect of this book and book series. It\\'s sad that this book series is almost over. I can\\'t get enough of it! 5 stars! Urgh. Reread December 2016 for Harry Christmas to You. This is another one that I\\'d forgotten pretty big parts of. If I had to pick a least favorite Harry Potter book, this would probably be it. It was a really interesting book, and there were certain small parts that I absolutely loved, but as a whole, it just didn\\'t quite measure up to my rereads of the rest. Reread December 2014 for Harry Christmas to You. I literally have no words. I feel like half the blood left my heart. I\\'m devastated. I think we can all agree that the basics are all the same in this series. You can\\'t arrive at your review of the sixth book and pretend that you\\'ll be saying anything new about the writing, world building, characters and development, plot progression and execution, etc. As always, all of these elements are impeccable in this sixth and second-to-last installment. I enjoyed it a bit more than the last one because our teenagers are feeling a little less angsty and are just about on the brink of adulthood. Well, Hermione and Ron, by wizarding standards, have or will have come of age during or shortly after this book, having turned 17. Harry will follow, of course, in July of the seventh book, which is usually where our books pick up. We have some added romance by way of Ron and Lavender... uh.. and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny. I don\\'t particularly think romance is a strong suit for Rowling - she really is a genius by way of mystery and fantasy, but I didn\\'t completely buy the Harry-Ginny thing. I\\'ve always felt a bit like that and I really made an effort to connect with them a bit more this time to see if I was maybe missing something, but I feel like I only made a small bit of progress. I like the idea of it, of favorite characters in a favorite series being together. I just didn\\'t like the execution and didn\\'t really feel much of the chemistry with them. I\\'ve never really felt that way about Hermione and Ron because their feelings for eachother are hinted at earlier on in the series and its easy to accept what you\\'ve been hoping for all that time. However, I did realize that I didn\\'t feel much in the way of chemistry on that front either, but like I said, it just is... meant to be... so it didn\\'t really bug me. The ending of this book still shocks me to the core no matter how many times I\\'ve read it or watched it play out on the big screen. I just hate it, though I know it serves a much bigger purpose. I tried hard to study Snape and his actions and dialogue, because really, we all know what happens, but I\\'d just like to understand it better. Something I\\'ve never understood, even from book one, was Snape\\'s rage and hatred toward Harry... or well, anyone who isn\\'t like Snape himself, I guess. I get the whole thing with his dad and the friends, but come on. Aren\\'t we all grown ups here? Well, again, I know it all serves a higher purpose, but its something I could never quite come to terms with. I can understand being cold and detached, but there were times throughout the series that Snape was downright cruel and even in this book, knowing what we know about book 7... I guess I won\\'t go getting all spoilery for the random person living under a rock who hasn\\'t read the book. There isn\\'t much else to say about this book other than how much I loved it and truly enjoyed it deep down in my bones. I\\'ve only read the last two books once before so I loved going through it all again, being able to study the parts that once confused me and really see deeper into the books. Though it was heartwrenching, it was enchanting and wonderfully done and I think it did the series justice. Its still going to take some time for me to figure out how I feel about it in reference to the other books. Definitely more toward the top of the list and there are only 7, so its not like they can all be my favorite. Re-read this book in 2007 in anticipation of the final book. One of my favorite books in the series. That ending still hits me hard.. so heartbreaking ** spoiler alert ** Not my favorite of the series, especially since Dumbledore died, but of course I loved it because I love all the Harry Potter books. This book seemed to be much more well-paced than the previous two. I enjoyed it a lot, and noticed a certain depth to it that the rest of preceding books lack. I think it may be the fact that Dumbledore plays a much larger roll. I also think that Rowling\\'s writing has improved with each book. On to the last book of my Harry Potter re-read-through! a bucketful of tears and a grin (because of the next generation of kids going into Hogwarts). That\\'s how i ended reading this series this year. Excellent. Always love JK Rowling. Not my favorite. It seems to be an aside from the main story arc of the series. Unpredictable! Harry Potter and the half-blood prince will make you figure out the puzzle. This book is so good. I remember reading it for the first time (how I wish I could have that experience again!) and just feeling my brain buzzing with the delight and excitement of finally putting the events of the previous books into their true context. Now, reading it again for the upteenth time, it has lost none of its charm and intensity. I know I\\'ll be reading it again many more times! Severus Snape. Best character ever written. Seriously, if you haven\\'t read this series, you are depriving yourself of one of the most magical experiences of your literary life. Fantasy must be for real... This is my favorite of the first six books. I loved it, though the end was so sad. I liked reading the Harry potter saga, but this book was not one of the best. It is as entertaining as the previous ones, but it lacks originality, and it is quite similar to all the others. This book and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows are my two favourites from the series. I remember getting this book on the midnight release and reading it consistently for 48 hours (with no sleep, no food, and no getting up from my chair!) I would re-read them again and again (if I had the time!). An absolute must-read for everyone, at least once in your life. Just put everything on hold cause this book just ripped me apart!! No words... cannot believe dumbledore died . irst sirius now him . his sucks and i know there will be more deaths coming but i just cant help it . hy ? his book was good no doubt the story line and everything but why dumbledore i could have waited till the last book you know *sobs* ow harry is completely alone no one to look after him *sobs again* Love this book. Harry Potter is a fun series. But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world. 11/1/2016: My favorite book in the entire series.. I still cry toward the end. Must -- reread -- before -- the movie -- comes out! Here\\'s the thing: I read this once to myself, once out loud to the family, listened to the audio, and am now re-reading before going to see the movie. Despite knowing everything that is going to happen, all the secrets and twists, this is so enjoyable! I\\'m as riveted as ever. This is probably my least favourite of the Harry Potter series. While it had more technical skill than the previous installment, in my opinion, the tone of the thing was just so different from the other books. What I remember most about it was the romances that abound, not the magic or the mystery. Surely I loved this one, but was also a bit disappointed as I expected something different to happen :( As I am re-reading (in audio format) in a short period of time all the Harry Potter books, I\\'ve realised that despite this one still being quite good it\\'s also, in my opinion, the weakest of the series. There is very little action and it\\'s mostly a volume to dump a lot of information on Voldemort and also to raise the expectations for the last and 7th volume. Still reading a bit each night with my son, this was by far my favorite book yet! So much happiness in this book; Harry finds out what his future entails, he suffers through a devastating loss, he confirms that some of his suspicions were accurate and he even gets to experiences some romance too! I personally didn\\'t love any of the books until this one. This particular installment really had everything. I was completely sucked into the Dr\\'s (especially the last half), the romance aspects for realistic and brought back lots of memories. I even laughed out loud several times. This book is action-packed, leaving me very eager for the grand finale! This is one of the best books I have ever read. It has amazing parallels of good vs evil and OH MY GOSH! It\\'s my favorite book in the series so far. umbledore by far is the most noble man I have ever heard about... The way he carried himself, expressed himself, and loved others has resonated with my heart so deeply! e was an amazing man, and I cried with tears of sorrow when he died. e made this book beautiful. arry Potter quite proved himself in this book as well. e has shown that he will fight the battle against Voldemort sacrificing the prospects of love and forging past the loss of Dumbledore, symbolic for protection and guidance. arry Potter is a true man with amazing morale. . I LOVE THIS BOOK! Holy cow. It is such a good, heart-wrenching read! Wow! ** spoiler alert ** That was pretty enjoyable. Even though I had seen meme\\'s about Snape Killing Dumbledore, I was still surprised when it happened. I don\\'t like how this book and the last just wind on and on after the pinnacle of the excitement. I don\\'t need to know who all attended Dumbledore\\'s funeral and that the merpeople sang for him and on and on. Maybe I would feel differently if I were really into it and I was reading it as it came out and not having all that formality in the way of me starting the next book. REREAD 2015 This is always the saddest book in the series for me :( REREAD 2013 It\\'s been almost 6 years since I last read Half-Blood prince. I\\'m so glad I decided to re-read this HP book. It\\'s just one of the strongest books in the series and I think this is one of my favorites in the series. So many feels though ;_; Everytime I finished one Harry Potter book I always said, I think this is my fave from all. So it turns out I have 4 fave fave books from this series.. Does it even make sense? I could only sigh. Last read Dec 8-10, 2010 Well other than Barry being a whiny brat I loved this book. they grow with you you\\'re not reading about a 16 year old in 11 year old language that\\'s nice ahw Dumbledore ))): I still can\\'t stop thinking about the ending of this book. And, I was even having dreams about Dumbledore last night after i finished it too. I mean, wth, seriously? While the Half-blood Prince is right up there with Prisoner of Azkaban for me, this one has been the most emotionally gripping and challenging so far. I\\'m still sad, confused, and worst of all, I feel betrayed - not only by the plot, but also by JRo. Why did you have to do this to Harry, to us readers? Why does evil always have to lurk its malevolent head around at the worst possible time? What happened to the happy endings of the first 3 years at Hogwarts? Well, I\\'m hoping the answers will come in Year 7, as I\\'m sure they will, and, more so than any of the others, I can\\'t wait to get started. Sigh...the only one he ever feared, yes indeed, the only one. JK Rowling must have done quite an elaborate series outline before writing the Harry Potter books! I was struck by how so many threads in previous books were coming together. I think this was the toughest one to read yet. I found it a little slower than the other books. I also had put it down in order to focus on book reviews and other life stuff. It\\'s been interesting to read Harry Potter and watch him grow up with adult eyes. Reread 2017 - this book was ruined for me by spoilers a day after it came out. This read was more enjoyable by far. I seem to have a theme for each Harry novel and this one was no exception, I like to refer to it as the Teenager Era. Yes, hormones are running rampid and Harry, is in love, is jealous, is fighting, and generally is just growing up. The entire novel reads almost like a prologue to the upcoming finale (except for the fact that its over 600 pages long). Things have stepped up a notch as the Wizarding world finally begins to acknowledge that the Dark Lord has returned, the Minister of Magic has been sacked as Knightbolt installed in his place. Under pressure to become the PR face of the Ministry, Harry returns to Hogwarts to discover Snape in the DADA position with Slugworth, an arrogant name dropping past professor of his parents now teaching Potions. The school terms become a series of papers and homework as Harry struggles to keep up, with the help of a Potions textbook, previously owned by one Half-Blood Prince. The events of the last few chapters seem almost isolated from the rest of the novel as it all rushes towards the tragic (and almost universally predicted) conclusion, truly setting the stage for the end. A much better read than the Angry Harry novel, but too many loose ends to be all that memorable. Good book, sadly not nearly as good as her other books. I have high hopes for the seventh book. I just hope she can pull off the darker feeling and still keep the plot in one piece. This brought out the darker side of the Magical world and how some students seemed to be able to fool Dumbledore... In the 6th Harry Potter book, Harry is using an old textbook for his potions class. Only he seems to be able to read the \"invisible\" ink that \"corrects\" some of the potions in the book. The book is signed \"Half-Blood Prince\". Harry is also taking personal lessons from Dumbledore. And more - actually a lot happens in this book! In fact more happened in this book than I remembered, and once again, I really enjoyed it, maybe more than the first time around. I listened to the audio narrated by Jim Dale. This is the third HP book I\\'ve listened to, narrated by him, and the fourth book I\\'ve listened to, overall, narrated by him. He\\'s finally growing on me and I finally see the appeal. He actually does do some very good effects while narrating, and it\\'s often easy to pick out who is speaking, just by the voices he does. ** spoiler alert ** Dumbledore dies? After all that? Snape is bad, after all the \"I trust him\" crap from D and the Order?! Arrgghh! I was not happy with this one. Very disappointed and sad . I wanted things to be happier, even though it\\'s a serious thing happening now, but still . Things tended to work out in the other books, but this one ends on a down beat. I hope the last one has some redeeming stuff. (A great series, all that aside). There\\'s a lot about this book I enjoy but I feel like there\\'s not much that happens. It\\'s just setting us up for the last book, which is appropriate. It\\'s a good thing I like the relationship aspect of this story or I think I would have been bored by this book. I sort of feel like she was getting tired of writing about school stuff. Harry is extra annoying here. \"Rawr, Draco. I hate Draco. I\\'m ANGRY. Voldemort isn\\'t controlling me anymore but let me argue with my best friends because EVERYTHING IS MALFOY\\'S FAULT.\" Females, especially teenage girls, do very strange things for revenge. Even knowing the ending, it hurts a bit to read. I watched the interview with Jim Dale in which he describes how he created the many, many voices of Rowling\\'s wonderful books. In it he mentions that he doesn\\'t like the word actor. He believes that the performer shouldn\\'t act the character, he should be the character. And, wow does he succeed! Jim Dale is bloody brilliant! I would listen to him read anything. Last time I read it: 4/2014 Reading this to Emma... October 24-26, 2012 - Rereading... October 25-27 2011 i think Half Blood Prince is now my favorite book of the series (hampir setara sm Goblet of Fire!) GA SIAP BUAT DEATHLY HALLOWS oh god I\\'ll write a joint review when I\\'m through the last book. Loved, loved, loved it! OotP starts getting into alot more action, and there\\'s even more in this book. I\\'ve read this book a few times and still tear up at the end. Re-read: 27/12/2016 This is probably my favorite Harry Potter book, mostly because even though it has a lot of sad and desperate moments, it also has a lot of bright ones (which is a nice change after Order of the Phoenix). Probably the most interesting part of Half-Blood Prince is all the time Harry spent with Dumbledore learning about Voldemort\\'s past. Another definite plus is, how to put it, romantic awaking of out main protagonists, although Ron and Hermione\\'s scenes were sometimes more than cringy. I was right there, standing next to Harry and feeling awkward during some of their conversations. What I really liked though was space Rowling gave Ginny. Although I\\'d still like to see even more of her, I can\\'t help but love what an amazing, funny and strong woman she is becoming. The ending, of course, left me heartbroken. ot only because of Dumbledore\\'s death, but also because of the pure fact that Harry won\\'t return to Hogwarts in the next book.  know that these books need to evolve, but I will REALLY miss Hogwarts with Ginny, Neville, Luna, McGonagall, etc. fter all, Hogwarts is Harry\\'s home. nd he\\'s already lost enough. All in all, re-reading these books is making me so devastated I\\'m really afraid to start reading the last one. But here we go anyway... My thoughts on this book are as follows: OMG DUMBLEDORE. That is all. Read: January 2009 December 2011 (Audiobook) November/December 2016 (Audiobook) This is the first book to make me ACTUALLY cry since TFIOS...not teary eyes, but SOBS. Bravo, JKR. Bravo. This is probably my most favorite Harry Potter book. It set the scene of what was going to happen in the Deathly Hallows. Also, this book gave more insight on Severus Snape. It also shows the burden that was placed on Draco and really how much he disliked it I\\'m really enjoying my re-read through the series. Jim Dale does an amazing job with the narration, and I don\\'t think these stories will ever get old for me. In this book we start to see the future romantical relationships between characters really crystallize, but my favorite part of Half-Blood Prince is the glimpses into Voldemort\\'s past. The flashbacks make the world seem fully-realized, a place that has always existed with its own rich history. I haven\\'t yet read any of the newly released Potterverse stories (I KNOW) but really, there is a reason that JKR is basically the richest person in the world. She has a fantastic imagination and I don\\'t even know how she managed to come up with all the details of the wizarding world. Like I said, I\\'m pretty sure these books will always amaze me. Always. I ugly cried through the last like, 75 pages of this book Lots of action in this one, although there were parts that seemed to drag a bit (mostly involving Slughorn, not one of my favorite characters). Harry does seem to be becoming more and more full of himself in this book, and at times I found myself sympathizing with Snape during their conversations. Others have criticized Hermione for her mooning over Ron, but I think she was presented as so serious, studious and older than her years in the first few books that the reader tends to forget she\\'s still a teenage girl and none of her actions are uncharacteristic for that age group. Cho Chang was MUCH more annoying, in my opinion, and I was happy that nothing developed there. I can\\'t believe there\\'s only one book to go (sadface). RIP Dumbledore This was my favorite out of the series, I loved how everything started coming together in this book. Reread in preparation for 7. Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter #6), by J.K. Rowling and Synopsis: The war against Voldemort is not going well; even Muggle governments are noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of the Daily Prophet, looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. And yet... As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate--and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. So it\\'s the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here at Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort--and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability. In A Sentence: My least favorite of the Harry Potter books, but still amazing My Thoughts: This book is such a whirlwind of....everything! Out of the seven books, I like this one the least, but that doesn\\'t mean this book isn\\'t awesome, no siree. Rowling did a great job depicting the life of a 16-year-old, I think. Their love lives, their attitudes, their opinions on what\\'s important, it was all in this novel, which is probably why this was my least favorite installment in the series (I\\'m not all that interested in teenage love stories, although some of these love stories were rather sweet). While there was a decent amount of action in this novel, I think what makes this book so good was the psychology behind it. There\\'s the psychology of a teenager, there\\'s the psychology behind good people and villains, there\\'s even psychology surrounding Voldemort and his past, which I found interesting (I kept asking my psychologist husband \"Is Voldemort a sociopath or a psychopath?\") Finally, there was that one part that, when I first read this, I couldn\\'t forgive Rowling for doing (if you\\'ve read this book, you know what I mean: that scene in the tower). In the final book, this part was satisfactorily explained, but I still hate the fact that the event happened! It was traumatic to read the first time around. Nowadays, I understand why it had to happen, but it still makes me very sad. Overall, I loved the story, but I can\\'t say it was ever my favorite. It\\'s the transitory story between Harry Potter the Kid, and Harry Potter the Man, and, like all middle stories, leaves you unsatisfied and ready for the final epic conclusion! Re-read 9/11/2012 I love Harry Potter so deeply I can\\'t even explain it. So much happens in this book, my heart is feeling all the feels, I was crying some minutes ago. GOSH I NEED A HUG. And as always, I just have to say it: Hagrid is perfection, what a precious character, he makes my heart melt, I adore him so so so much. 2nd best HP book After the prisoner of Azkaban ! I enjoyed every word in it ,, specially Voldemort\\'s history Incredible. Amazing. Took my breath away. Unlike everything I\\'ve ever read. Fantastic world. I especially liked the change of relationship between Ron and Hermione. They were so funny and sweet by moments. They are my favorite couple in the series, by the way. :D 3 RTCs in a row! I am drowning! First book I\\'m changing the rating for during this series re-read. I wish I\\'d written a review last time, because I don\\'t actually remember why I only gave this 3 stars before? It was my lowest personal rating of any book in the series, and I\\'ve also always considered it to be my least favourite of all the books. Which is...puzzling, I guess, because I really enjoyed it this time around. As with Order of the Phoenix, I\\'d forgotten a lot of the details but I just flew through it this week.  can only assume that a big part of my somewhat lower rating was the whole Harry/Ginny thing, which ... well, let\\'s be honest, I\\'m never going to be a fan of them but I\\'ve mostly gotten past it. ddly enough, I never shipped anyone the first time around, and that hasn\\'t changed.  don\\'t have any particularly strong feelings towards any of the couples.  would\\'ve preferred, for instance, Harry/Ron/Hermione to just stay best friends all their lives, without any couples being formed within their little group. f I absolutely HAD to choose between wanting Ron/Hermione and Harry/Hermione as a romantic pairing, I would have to choose the latter. ut even so, it wouldn\\'t be wholeheartedly; I all prefer them as friends. ostly because, in my opinion, Rowling\\'s strong suit just isn\\'t romance. \\'m not swooned by the way she writes it and I know we were supposed to believe that Ginny\\'s crush on Harry had just been put on the back-burner all these years, but as a result of the way she wrote it, I just didn\\'t buy it. his was less of an issue for Ron and Hermione, but honestly, Harry seems to notice Ginny from one day to the next (goodye, Cho!) nd then Ginny suddenly reveals she never really stopped hoping and lol, no. ut anyway, as I said before I\\'ve made my peace with it (or I\\'ve tried) and it bothered me less this time. I love this book for so many reasons - first and foremost the further character development, which really does seem to get better with each book - and the ending didn\\'t fail to turn me into a blubbering mess again. ut of all the deaths in these books, Dumbledore\\'s will always hit me the hardest.  may have cried less than I did the first time, but cry I did.  was being strong, up until the point where Harry follows McGonagall into Dumbledore\\'s office and there\\'s a new portrait on the wall, with the old Headmaster snoozing peacefully.  lost it, then. e is without a doubt one of my favourite characters, because he is all that is good in the world and yet Rowling made him flawed as well and I just.  LOVE HIM A LOT, OKAY. There was more I wanted to say, but I\\'ve forgotten it all in light of the ending. *Read: April 2011, June 2016 \"It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world.\" Great addition to an outstanding series. Harry and the gang are growing and learing more and more about Harry\\'s History as well as some pretty deep stuff concerning Snape. Amazing Series. I enjoyed a lot of the background information given in this story, and I loved how much time Harry was able to spend with Dumbledore. That ending though, made me tear up for the first time in the books and IT JUST WASN\\'T RIGHT, OKAY?? Old review I wrote on my blog (http://douglascootey.com) on 21 November 2005: Last summer I waited in line with my daughters for the most eagerly anticipated book of the year: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The book was well worth the wait. It was the best written since Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I pegged some events correctly and was surprised by others. I found the book entertaining, and would even recommend it to non-Harry Potter fans as a place to start the series. I\\'m going to be discussing some plot spoilers in this review so if that sort of thing bothers you you\\'ve just read my review in a nutshell and don\\'t need to read further. I had problems with Book Four, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Although I enjoyed much of what happened in the book the ending nearly killed me. Once we learned that Barty Crouch Jr. was posing as Moody we were treated to a full chapter of exposition as he recounted the entire story all over again, but from his point of view. I found it dreadfully dull and often skipped through it. Only this year did I learn that JK Rowling enjoys Dorothy Sayers and that Goblet of Fire\\'s ending fit the classic Sayers\\' style ending. I had problems with Book Five, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, as well. I found it overly long at times and in need of a good edit. Interestingly, JK Rowling felt the same. \"There are bits of all six books that I would go back and tighten up. My feeling is that Phoenix is overlong, but I challenge anyone to find the obvious place to cut.\" This isn\\'t to say that I didn\\'t enjoy those books. I\\'ve read them so many times I\\'ve lost count. I\\'m just saying that these books had flaws in execution and length. The same couldn\\'t be said for Book Six, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. This is the tightest book she\\'s written to date. The narrative was woven well. The characters were well fleshed out, there weren\\'t any personality changes pulled out of a hat like Ginny\\'s character in Book Five, and the back story balanced well with current events. Not only did we see an end to CAPS LOCK Harry, but exposition was much improved from earlier books. Instead of having the story explained from the mouths of Hermione, Dumbledore, or Crouch, we had pensieve episodes which worked much better in my opinion, proving the old writer\\'s adage: \"Show it, don\\'t tell it.\" This was a well written adventure story. Interestingly, I had three predictions proven to be true, which is good even for me. First, Dumbledore died, paving the way for Harry to finally stand on his own. Until now, and as Harry himself had pointed out in Book Five, he\\'s been very lucky and always saved by somebody else. Now there will be no teachers to rescue him. No guardian angels waiting in the wings. Our hero cannot be a hero until he fights insurmountable odds on his own. Second, we discovered the horcruxes. I had predicted a few years ago, based on events in Book Two, that Voldemort had obtained immortality by imbuing inanimate objects with his soul, as he had done with the dairy. I was delighted to be right about this one, and the third prediction: that it would be too much to expect the horcruxes to be laying about Hogwarts so Harry would have to go on a quest to find them. There are still mysteries to be revealed in Book Seven, such as the importance of Harry\\'s green eyes and how that relates to Lilly, his mother, or what significance his scar has yet to play beyond it\\'s iconic purposes. Book Six tied up enough loose ends to satisfy, but left enough untied to keep the reader looking forward to the next installment. Much has been made of how dark this book is compared to the others. I\\'m not sure where people\\'s heads have been. Harry Potter and the Sorceror\\'s Stone started with murder, abandonment, and child abuse. It was garnished with bullying, hinted with dark disembodied cloaks that fed on fresh unicorn blood, then topped with life threatening trials and ordeals. And that was all before facing the grand baddie himself. All that has changed is Harry has grown up, gone through his angry teenage years and now is ready to be a man. The framework for this was laid in the first book for this progression, but the books have always been dark. As for romances, much has been made about them as well, but JKR will not be known as a great romance novelist. The \"romance\" in the books is, as we Americans would put it, High School stuff. Meeting at lockers, making out in the equipment room, etc. No surprise there. They\\'re still students. We have yet to see if Harry and Ginny have the greatest written love scenes of teen fiction yet to come. In fact, I suspect that it is quite plausible for Ginny to die, sacrificing herself and protecting Harry with the same charm his mother once used on him, but I\\'m not holding my breath. The romance will be there, but secondary to the action and adventure experienced by our hero, Harry Potter. It is his story, told through his eyes, and unless Harry suddenly becomes a hopeless romantic the story\\'s narrative will focus on the same elements it always has. Could a Harry Potter fan ask for anything more? My appreciation for this sixth book in the series has grown since the last time I read it. It\\'s a much tighter story than I remembered, and the lead up to the tragic ending is a lot more evident on a second reading. I think a lot of what confused me about it now is the flashback scenes told in the Pensieve. I don\\'t think I quite grasped what was going on the first time, and I\\'m really not sure why, because it\\'s not a terribly difficult plot when you get right down to it. In any case, I found myself reading a lot faster and absorbing a lot more of the mythology behind Voldemort\\'s rise to power this time, and bits of Deathly Hallows are actually clearer now that I\\'ve gone back and re-read this one. There\\'s also a sense of urgency to this novel that the fourth and fifth books seemed to lack. This book doesn\\'t meander, it knows where it\\'s going and what it\\'s leading to, and I really appreciate that about this book. My review of the audiobook version Review from re-read in 2009: I\\'d forgotten how much fun this book is. I say fun, despite the last four or five chapters. The interaction between Harry, Hermione, and Ron was interesting and fun, especially the growing romantic dynamic between Hermione and Ron. Harry falling for Ginny, and his twisting emotions regarding \\'bros before hos\\' was good to read. The memories are, point blank, the best part of the book. The look into Voldemort\\'s past, and Harry\\'s reaction to how he lived and seeing the similarities between the two of them, were the perfect way to bring in facts about Voldemort without getting boring. The final scenes were amazing. The first one that I loved was Draco vs Dumbledore. The emotion coming from Malfoy were heart wrenching, and Dumbledore slowly losing strength and slipping down the wall just squeezed the heart to pieces. My favorite scene, and to be honest, the scene I was most looking forward to in the movie (NOT BITTER), was the final scene between Snape and Harry. Harry freaking out and throwing out a Crucio curse, then attempting Snape\\'s own spells on him, and Snape\\'s overwhelming fury. We\\'d never seen Snape lose it up to that point, it was always cold and quiet anger. For him to lose his shit so completely and proclaim himself the HBP was just amazing. I\\'m now itching to re-read book 7 after this. Ahhh, HP. How I miss you. I re-read this in anticipation of seeing the film. What can one say. The saga continues. The best aspect of this for me was the characterization of adolescence. I thought she hit a home run with that. Harry is a flawed hero, more than willing to take a short cut to help his grades, even if that means possible corruption. Ron and Hermione play sexual tennis, both wanting the other but neither able to take a direct approach. Harry is interested in Ginny, but takes a very Peter Parker role at the end in rejecting her for her own safety. The identity of the Half-blood prince is revealed at the end and provides a nifty twist. We are also strung along with the question of whether Snape is or isn\\'t working for the dark side. Is Dumbledore really gone, or has he found a way to preserve a portion of his soul by arranging his own death? There are talismans that are left unanalyzed that will no doubt provide the roots of the final book. It was a very enjoyable ride in the classic series of our time. A small pet peeve is that I think poor Ron deserves better than to be the ever-present comic relief. Even though I knew what was coming, even though I remembered this book much better than the others, I still couldn\\'t put it down. The relationship between Dumbledore and Harry is probably my favorite in the whole series, to say nothing of the character of Dumbledore himself. I find the scenes between the two of them, which drive much of this novel, to be some of Rowling\\'s best writing. Slughorn\\'s good fun too. As horrible as it seems to sound Tom Riddle, aka Lord Voldemort, has to be one of my favorite characters of all time. He\\'s a baddy, yes. He tries to kill off--and in some cases succeeded in doing so--some of the most beloved characters in this series, yes. However, his story and history is so amazingly developed that it has become an impossibility for me not to love this character. It\\'s a guilty pleasure. This book might as well consist entirely of Voldemort\\'s history, or a great deal of it anyhow, and for that I love it. Well done, Rowling! Beaten only by Order of the Phoenix, and that was by barely. Exact rating: 4.75 I didn\\'t like this as much but it was still BRILLIANT. But in the mean time, I\\'ve so much hate for this book, Dumbledore, Snape, Malfoy. I\\'ve literally never hated anybody as much as I\\'ve hated Snape in my 17 years of living. How dare he, that fucking son of a shit. alf blood prince? ore like prince of garbage. nd... and how can Rowling kill Dumbledore? sobs* I knew he\\'d die but I didn\\'t expect it to be effing Malfoy.  didn\\'t think I\\'ll cry when Dumbledore died, honestly, I didn\\'t fancy his character that much but the impact was bigger than expected. y heart breaks for everybody at Hogwarts. his is too much for me to express my feelings. I just can\\'t this is unacceptable. Another solid book of storytelling. The different plot lines weave together smoothly and compliment each other in terms of relevancy and interest. After watching the movie of this book, I concluded that I actually like the romance of Ginny and Harry much much better in the book. It\\'s sweeter and not as much of a surprise. They have longer to be together and that is nice, and Ginny, for some reason to me, is cooler in the book than she is in the movie. She\\'s the popular one while Harry is the well known one, which is slightly different than being popular. I continue to like this book very much and realize that things about the horcruxes and such make way more sense to me now. Not sure why - maybe I just read the book too fast the first time around. This had always been one of my faves in the series when I was younger, and I am happy to say that this is still one of my faves now too!!! Also I\\'ve been trying, throughout this whole series, to understand people who like Snape and justify his actions for everything, but honestly he\\'s just a horrible person. *heart breaks into a thousand tiny pieces* Chapter 26 (the cave) was my favorite chapter out of all the books so far. The imagery was awesome. It reminded me a lot of the Hobbit when Bilbo meets Gollum. 31/2 stars, rounded up to 4. Compared to the last two, it\\'s just seems more... mundane? prosaic? Still really enjoyed it (and was reading it 3 + 4 chapters at a time...) and/but/so brief anecdote: I\\'ve never read this series. My son (currently 51/2 as I write this) received the first book for Christmas 2012. So we\\'ve been reading them aloud together. As of Christmas 2013, we had read the first 3 books, and then he received the entire collection as a gift. So we read book 4. And as his dad I thought to myself: well that got dark in a hurry. And I figured maybe it was too frightening for him, or at least too heavy. But he insisted he could take it. And that he wanted to advance to book 5. So we did, and though it wasn\\'t necessarily darker (because the surprise death of Cedric is still pretty much the pivotal moment in the series, in my opinion), when we reached the end of #5, he told me that it had \"scary parts\" and that he wanted me to read ahead to make sure it wasn\\'t too scary. Anyway, I\\'m glad he did, because there were a few little bits in here that would be tough for him to digest. So there\\'s that. co-dependency might be an unhealthy foundation for a relationship, but if our addictions are complementary, shucks, I\\'ll have no problem spinning this out forever. or, like, irony time? that bag I sold you yesterday was short? what you on, cra... oh wait. right. well, I don\\'t sell slim bags baby. that bag was phat. this bag gonna be even more phat. focus on what you got. oh man, I guess these sorts of drug pictures and references have to end eventually. that and Captain Crunch will get us everything. but, of course I can\\'t help but repeat BFA Bachelor of Fine Arts means addiction equals ability. I really really can spin out 10000 characters a day indefinitely. and wherever it goes, it probably won\\'t end up in a breach, but then maybe it will. unfortunately, since the single applauding audience member is declining to provide direct feedback about the text provided, we\\'re left with the mere repetition of certain tired tropes. as in, \"textual healing,\" \"safe text,\" \"text before marriage,\" \"text in the morning,\" whatever. any halfwit (self) can crack halfjokes all night long. BFA burn baby burn. in all seriousness though, without direct commentary on the subject at hand, the default subject will continue to be the nature of art itself, the secrets of art, the inner world of musicians or whatnot, at least as spied out by a reasonable competent outsider. what this means is the old undergraduate conversation of \"what were we 15000 years ago?\" answer: Tukk, Fjik, Reek, and Jjek-- preverbal, nomadic people who followed buffalo herds and chased mammoths, existing in tribes of about 150 people, no more. hence, our current evolved human mental limit of 150 personalities. now \"the first profession\" is immediately known. the second arrives after some thought. (rot13: rfcvbantr). But what is the third profession of humanity ? answer: S H A M A N! available genetic evidence suggests that between 1-2% of human beings are born as shaman, inclined to wear bird feathers and chant weirdly haunting songs. then, this profession evolved through ancient greece into the dramatic and lyrical arts, the historian (bleh), the musician. and today musicians are still amongst us today, looking at us, checking us out, and discussing us within their own enclosed worlds. I completely stand by my claim that KPP\\'s INVADER carries the subliminal message of INDIE POP; viz., Yasutaka Nakata is deliberately trying to get Tokyo (and other Japanese cities\\') indie pop musicians, mostly early 20 something and at art colleges, on his side. pretty tricky. the relationship in Western settings tends to be, well, more adversarial. in fact, I believe there are currently open law suits regarding the practice of \"sampling,\" which the Supreme Court no less settled in favour of the big name rather than the little guy. this despite the fact that the little guys are like 300 rappers and hip hop artists in the Dirty South or in NYC whose hooks were basically just lifted by a record label rhyming with Mef Kam. how\\'s that for intra-artist battles. this is kind of why the 2013 battle between carpet bombers, goodreaders, the \"management,\" the enforcers, whoever carries a tinge of interest as an object of study itself. I mean, who exactly is battling but a very limited circle of book devotees. the entire \"GR reviewer elite\" is like 200 people. what this results in is what political scientist Samuel Huntington called \"the super-empowered individual.\" the Internet has released certain economies of scale and certain network effects, hence, actually 20 organized GR reviewers actually probably shake things up--- if only for the fact that unity is actually pretty difficult to achieve. Mass sentiment, of course, in the end is in favour of the resistance forces, but there are walls that do not breach easily. they exist. does this make more or less sense without coming off legalistic? I\\'m reading John Grisham right now... thoughts all in legal worlds... but the banking sector recently did me a good turn and fedex\\'d me a replacement card across the Pacific. so it\\'s not always chaos, and it\\'s not always Filipino CSRs answering phones to argue with the Japanese teller girl right in front of your face... KPP in any case, continues to blast from speakers off Center-Gai, and in Shinjuku settings as well. somebody opened the lower drawers at the BOOKOFF (that name is not a typo, nor is their brief corporate cousin, the HARDOFF, *cough*), and aesthetic analysis had to be forced on that issue as well, as Japanese commentary on sandaled feet gave way to the rush of traffic, the speeding kei-trucks, the observation that we might all be getting way too far ahead of ourselves with the references that can\\'t be referenced. and I thought also of the Pennsylvania reviewer with his footnotes: at once a part of the Diaz tradition; at another remove, just part of the whole US thing. but that\\'s the whole problem, right? do we ever know ourselves? I could comment more on aesthetics so I guess I am forced to in a sense. overall people agree that Japanese aesthetics are superior to even many Western cultural models. late 15th century Japanese logos look like modern 2014 variants; there are costumes preserved from 11th century Japanese naval fleets that would not look horrible worn today on a Paris street. in contrast, Sino aesthetics are considered overly cloying, sweet, colorful. yet the SIno response is to claim a deeper Wu/Satori; a greater connection to the Tianxia/Daishi concept. we\\'ll have to leave that for another day. the other flip side of aesthetics, of course, is also, does superior aesthetics compensate for lack of morality? if I viciously beat a hapless 12 year old in the head for the laughs, should I receive a shorter prison sentence if I did so with a giant pink alligator? questions, even entire classroom discussions, can be molded on this topic, but in any case, it is 12:45am in the morning and I don\\'t want the brain to sound too sleep addled. better to jump around and say... C A M D E N T I M E S H A R E!! ha, we can\\'t leave that. suffice to say Etienne has not been around lately but Nadine threw me a possibly passionate look. small girl doesn\\'t care two figs about me, but African boy toy possibly made an ambiguously ambiguous remark. then there\\'s the relatively ineffectual French boys, who are not really participating heavily in social affairs. and that leads, of course, to the repetition of the larger unchallenged point in global settings, English boys are favoured over English girls, but French girls are favoured over French boys. hmm... do the accusations of prejudice fly yet? and if we mind-experimented the idea of a fashionable dinner party with French girls and English girls, are we absolutely absolutely sure the most desirable girl present would be French? Girls Aloud would disagree... I\\'ll go out on a limb though and point out that ROMANCE cultures might be argued as more feminine, evocative, instinctual; GERMANIC cultures more logical, cold, masculine, reserved. we are, unfortunately, GERMAN. we may have been conquered by the Normans in 1066, but that was almost a thousand years ago. Pig and Whistle. Elephant and Castle. because of our own Germanic nature, what we can\\'t realize about ourselves is how oppressive our own existence is to everyone else. that\\'s why I can\\'t complete sympathies for our government\\'s stance in Eastern Europe, where Anglo-Americans and the EU seem to be bandwagoning together... hmm... this is probably a topic for a whole another day, but, hey, Russians can be odd, but some of them can be all right. if that makes me a polar bear, why bark bark bark/ other random animal encounters: cats mostly, some ravens, foot-stomping in Ravenspot. Rvaenspot= hidden double secret location in Yoyogi park, once you find it, you\\'ll know. maybe the precise PSYCHOGEOGRAPHIC centre of the Shinjuku-Shibuya axis. and maybe Harajuku is centre BECAUSE Shimo-kitazawa is to the west, Shin-okubo to the north, Aoyama to the east (fantastic planned architecture), and Meguro to the south. in other words, not just a fashionable neighborhood, but a fashionable series of neighborhoods surrounded each in turn by other fashionable meccas. and yes, I\\'m rambling, but I\\'m rambling if you get what I mean, and psychogeography is oh-so-hot these days isn\\'t it. a science before its time. a French specialty too, I believe. doobie-doobie-doo... feel free to specify what you... [want] in general particularistic terms, the miyashita railway park (a copycat of the high line?) represents a great insider\\'s only access point to Shibuya, and then NHK\\'s location at the top of Yoyogi hill gives it not just a view of Mount Fuji but bragging rights to its central place in J-media. Fuji Television, Asahi TV, these are good competitors, but perhaps only Japan has a BBC equivalent as one of its three major stations, to be torn only by the controversy that its president recently denied wartime atrocities. I actually wonder what the foreign staff think-- grandpa was slain on the Bridge to the River Kwai, but my company\\'s CEO has declared there was no war whatsoever. hmmm. but in one bone to toss to the J-right, I can absolutely declare with absolute certainty that there is no secret Japanese doomsday device located in G-CANS or Mount Fuji. I know dozens of people who would have to be involved were there such a thing; there are, as all fanatics are, completely sane in behaviour and speech. whoa instead of exploring this little chain of thought, I will explore the question of how creating \"artificial break points\" is useful for a healthy progression and relationship with time. if I absolutely declare to myself that I will cut off a relationship with a girl if she does not answer my telephone message within 2 weeks, then even if I crushingly submit to her lack of response and way my behind obediently after the two weeks, at least a mental roadblock has been set up in my decline, right. I think that is part of the way towards making time, the immortal force, at least not totally an enemy. however, I am speaking from the last of \"young adulthood,\" and can\\'t necessarily make broad judgments about life, even if I am your father. I mean, these things aren\\'t always related. instead, my immediate might be to riff a little on why the supposed femininity of French culture versus the supposed masculinity of English/Germanic culture makes the English male / French female relationship ever so more harmonious than the reverse. what is going on is a matching of cultural inclinations, yes? but conversely, the culturally English females who make up 36% of my goodreads friends list will naturally feel averse to hearing in precise detail why the French female is inherently more female than them, well, we are treading some very choppy waters here. [image error] I am very displeased to hear that you believe English females are less feminine than their French counterparts. Expelliarmus! impressions are easy! mimicry is fun! Hermione Granger was not supposed to be too cute, Hollywood lies! in the interests of a general explanation of why I adopt English spellings from time to time, I guess it should also be pointed out that expat life is full of more English and Australians and Commonwealthers in general. yes, the expat bubble, in which we finally understand what we are. but, America, being a continent of some 300 million, does not necessarily need all the international understanding that storm-drenched islands in the north sea require. if England failed to understand the Continent, it would have been overwhelmed. England = Japan in that sense, but also not in another. in any case, we have far exceeded the 10000 character jump point and are not making up the deficit created the last time when a J girl interrupted me, I mean a French girl. I was working for Park Hyatt Shinjuku I mean Kensington Park. I am revealing trade secrets or nothing at all. they tried to send me another letter. fail. it might cause massive offensive if I speculate as to whether Chinese or Japanese girls are more feminine, as this is an examination of whether China or Japan is more feminine. hmmm... I am spinning word balloons aren\\'t I. I am organising marriages. time to say good night, GR. if the point hasn\\'t been repeated enough, I am a four-year trained Bachelor of Fine Arts, and I can word smith 10000 characters a day for two or three years. however, not every country in the world permits access to the Goodreads website. if one of these countries employs me, then this period will also come to an end. so specify the topics you desire, time may not be unlimited This is in my top 3 favorite Harry Potter books, along with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone. Everything really starts to come together in this book, and the ending just took my breath away! I am anxiously awaiting this movie (this fall! )...the trailer I\\'ve seen looks awesome! After Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix kicked off the fight between the Order of the Phoenix and Voldemort\\'s Death Eaters, I couldn\\'t wait to read the continuation. This book successfully builds on the previous Harry Potter books, and fits into the series as the link between the first five books and the last one. J.K. Rowling again includes creatures and magic drawn from ancient cultures and magical legends, and the dialog and drama elevate the book well beyond the level of a traditional children\\'s book. I\\'m so happy to re-read this book. It reminds me why is my favourite <3. ***SPOILER ALERT*** This book was really amazing it even made me cry. Even if I know a lot of spoilers which my friend have told me about Snape being the Half Blood Prince, Snape killed Dumbledore, Ginny and Harry being together, about the horcrux was a fake, my friend actually told me the summary of this book. I think even if I know a lot of what was going to happen I still find it painful to read it especially the part when Dumbledore was killed and Hagrid was talking to Harry and Hagrid doesn\\'t know at that moment that Dumbledore was already dead. It was really painful for me and i cried at that point because it was like suddenly the most person that you think the greatest of them all and actually the one wizard that Voldemort feared was dead. To think that Snape killed him and that the horcrux was fake i feel really terrible that it all ended that way. I think that this ending was more depressing than when Sirius Black was killed on the Order of the Phoenix. There were so many questions that really need answers. That would make you after reading this book think, be nervous about what would possibly happen. I really felt that this was a good book and hope that the movie would not disappoint me. I saw a trailer of it wherein the burrow was burned it\\'s not in the book though. I can\\'t wait to buy \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows.\" Really Harry Potter series made me hooked that i truly recommended everyone to read this book. Much better than the last few books, less angst, phew! June 25th, 2016 - July 5th, 2016 (4.5 stars) Rereading before The Cursed Child comes out. Really enjoyed reading this, I was reminded of the first time I read it. It\\'s kind of frustrating reading it now because I know Draco is going to bring Death Eaters into the castle and Dumbledore will die but I don\\'t ever want it to happen! October 5th, 2014 - October 11th, 2014 (5 stars) A lot fancier than the UK version, I especially like the little touches like the different fonts and Hagrid\\'s tear-stained letter. The pictures were nice though the book is a lot bigger as a result, so not quite so portable - I kept my UK edition in my bag for reading when out and about, and kept the US edition by the bed for reading at home. Had good fun spotting all the differences between the UK edition and this one, things like whiskey, Sorceror\\'s Stone and pants. Would like to get the US editions of the rest of the series. As the release of the seventh book nears, I thought it would be prudent to refresh my memory of the Potter mythos. So I reread Book 6. As I remembered, it was one of the high points of the series--made all the more excellent by the fact that it followed the lackluster fifth book. Harry has overcome most of the childish petulance that both marked and marred his character in Book 5 and Rowling returns to (and further perfects) the formula for adventure that has made the series so popular with readers the world over. As every one of the books feature some authorial missteps, so does the penultimate installment. Still, nothing quite so off-putting as Hermione\\'s house elf activism. The romantic torment and jealousy (the most ill-wrought portion of Book 6) is mild and does not drag out like Harry\\'s attitude did in Book 5 (and in truth, it seemed much longer the first time I read). As well, the chapter leading up to the climax was weakly conceived and was the only point at which I felt the book dragged (both in my first reading and in this re-read). In any case, a well-done book and one that whets well the appetite for the conclusion. p.s. it also had a ton of typos--which seemed strange to me. I remember being surprised to learn that Harry would not be attending Hogwarts for his final year of school, but upon rereading, it\\'s clear that by Book Six, Hogwarts has become little more than a place for Harry to bump into the other characters. The various romantic subplots are perhaps the strongest reminder of the youth of the main characters, and while there are a few Quidditch matches thrown into the mix and occasional offhand references to classes, homework, and studying, it would be relatively easy to transfer the story to another setting altogether. Rowling has almost completely abandoned her formula, but surprisingly, it seems to work. Still, I was disappointed to find that Snape\\'s promotion to teaching Defense against the Dark Arts was only a plot point in so much as it made it possible for Harry to continue potions classes. Harry\\'s conflict with Snape (and, by proxy, his conflict with the legacy of his father), much more so than his conflicts with Draco or Voldemort, has become the most interesting motive force of the plot, and I found myself waiting for Rowling to take advantage of Snape\\'s intrusion into Harry\\'s territory. As for the rest of the book, I found Dumbledore\\'s lessons to be unnecessarily drawn out; Slughorn\\'s memory seemed somewhat less than crucial, since Dumbledore most certainly already knew what a Horcrux was and why Voldemort might want one. At least, however, Rowling relied much less on prolonging the plot by having one character unnecessarily withhold information that would easily resolve everything. This is not my favorite book in the Harry Potter series. (I would be hard pressed to tell you which one is, but I know it\\'s not this one.) Regardless, it\\'s still a wonderful book. We continue on with Harry\\'s tale, fighting evil along the way. As the series goes on the books become a little darker and Harry a little moodier. Some readers may not enjoy this. However, it doesn\\'t bother me much, because it seems true to Harry\\'s character and the things he\\'s going through in his life. Harry\\'s friends, teacher\\'s and classmates are as true to their characters as ever. It\\'s quite a treat to immerse myself into this magical world. There are some romances introduced in this story as well. Nothing gets graphic or anything, but it\\'s a reminder that the characters are growing up and not far from becoming adults. This book has left me quite emotional. There are some BIG events that make readers aware that the end of the story is getting closer all the time. If you\\'re reading this review and haven\\'t tried the Harry Potter series - stop, go get books 1-7, and get started reading! ** spoiler alert ** I can\\'t believe they killed Dumbledore. Annual reread. I love JK, but romance is not her strong point. I think I enjoyed this book most of them all. Rowling\\'s sense of humor never lets the reader down, and her touch with teen emotions is so deft. The old plot veers slightly as Voldemort himself fails to appear--but we learn all about his past as, at last, Dumbledore talks to Harry and answers Questions. There is a surprise at the end that was no surprise to this adult reader, but it certainly was to the kids I taught. It was interesting to see how Rowling set it up, cushioning it, in effect, so the kid reader would see it as inevitable. t was also interesting to see how she set upSnape  as a shadow prince to Harry\\'s Prince. It was obvious to me where this was going to go, but it was interesting watching kids try to guess. Harry\\'s \\'shadow\\' and he are seemingly adversaries, meanwhile the Voldemort threat is kept alive. There are a lot of good world building touches in this book. Though magic still doesn\\'t quite seem to do anything whatever besides provide means for magic wars, the otherworldly touches are fascinating--the phoenix, the centaurs, the mer folk, and of course the various monsters. Characterwise, there are some satisfying pair-ups. Again, I was glad to see far less emphasis on good blood and social status. Fleur, who was so tiresome in the past, gets off one of the best lines in the book. The most intense HP book yet! I love how Harry\\'s become a strong, dark, brave man, yet not an anti-hero. I\\'m pretty sure everyone know that DUMBLEDORE DIES. so no spoiler alert. But what surprised me about the death was not the death ITSELF but the fact that I didn\\'t feel anything. I didn\\'t really care. I sort of read the passage emotionless. The spell and everything. I didn\\'t hate Snape. or Malfoy. or feel what all of the other Hogwarts teachers felt. Not that I felt happy. I just didn\\'t feel anything. And that\\'s when it hit me. J K Rowling\\'s attempt to create a wise and caring mentor for Harry failed. Dumbledore was anything BUT a good mentor. How could he hire Lockhart, Quirrel, fake Moody, and Umrbridge when he had the student\\'s BEST interests at heart? Isn\\'t he supposed to be skilled in Legilimens? Shouldn\\'t he have fought the Ministry\\'s attempt to interfere at Hogwarts? And shouldn\\'t he have prepared Harry better? He doesn\\'t tell Harry ANYTHING about defeating Hogwarts... at the end of every book, he give some lame speech about Harry\\'s bravery and about how LOVE saved him. Only in the sixth book does he attempt to show Harry anything about Voldemort\\'s death... and then he dies. Because he put on the ring because he was tempted by the power or something. He selfishly kills himself when Harry needs him most. When he could have kept Hogwarts safe from Voldemort.. and could have kept Dumbledore\\'s Army safe from the Carrows\\' beatings. So Dumbledore dies. And Harry\\'s left alone to fight Voldemort.. with barely any lead.. or anything to go for. And that\\'s all due to Dumbledore. Is Harry Potter truly the Chosen One? Potter is 16 now, entering his 6th year at Hogwarts, and just a year shy of \"adulthood\" in the wizard world. He\\'s still shaken by the loss he suffered at the end of book 5, but he\\'s been safe at the Dursley\\'s over the holiday break. Still the Dark Lord\\'s forces are gathering strength and there is considerable danger about. This book gives the reader a bit more insight into the life of the boy who became Voldemort. Rowling uses this look at the past to teach an important lesson about how our choices define who we are and what we become. Friendship and loyalty remain a central theme. It\\'s a fast and enjoyable read, and highly recommended for Potter fans. Audio book performed by Jim Dale. Jim Dale\\'s performance of this book is wonderful. His pacing and his facility for different voices lend drama and excitement. His sonorous tones give life to Snape, Dumbledore, Hagrid and Voldemort; and he is still able to give us a hint of youth for Harry and the other young wizards (though he\\'s really not very good at the young women - Hermione, Ginny, Lavender, et al). Where to even begin? I remember when the movie had came out, before I had even started reading the series. See I thought it was just another one of those series that people obsess over and make all these dumb fan clubs. (Which is true but I am now a Potter geek myself.) Anyway...people at school were saying how Dumbledore dies and how he is a great wizard and all that. I forgot what they had said by the time I started reading. It wasn\\'t till I started reading this book when I realizes Dumbledore was the great wizard that was going to die. I hoped it wasn\\'t going to be this book, but I was wrong. I enjoyed Draco growing as a character and not being so....arrogant. Seeing him from going from being so high to having troubles, made him so much more real. Since Dumbledore was teaching Harry about Voldemort\\'s past, I was sure the half-blood prince was him. He was a half -blood as we learned and an heir. Since he always wanted to be special, he called himself a prince. To my great surprise, it was Snape. Then he shocked me even more by killing Snape. Ron and Hermione irritated me to no end. It is clear that they both like each other and I\\'m pretty sure Harry can see that. But why doesn\\'t he help them?? I usually can stand their bickering, but like the entire book, they are ignoring each other. It made my day when Harry got with Ginny. They have some really great chemistry and I hope that doesn\\'t get lost on screen. I understand why he ended it in the end, but I wish he never did that. Good book. The Harry Potter series is definitely a series everyone should read, so if you haven\\'t, go get them! It\\'s a fun and magical read about family, friends, freedom, and a continuous battle between good and evil. J.K. Rowling did a fantastic job with this series! Really bringing it to life and sending a good message to young readers, and even adults. The writing is good, not too detailed though because it is a children\\'s series (though enjoyable for all-ages). The plot throughout the series is well thought out. There are some parts in each book where it gets a little long and dull, but if you push through it it\\'ll go back to being exciting. I thought that the fifth book (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix) was dragged out to the point that is was dull, but all the other books will keep you sucked in until the last page. My favorites out of the series are Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. There are a few swear words throughout the series but nothing too bad and not that many, they show up very rarely (mostly in the beginning books of the series). You really connect with all of the characters, and there are so many that you can relate with one if not more. The creatures in this series are also really cool, dragons, centaurs, mermaids, giants, and more. This series really lets your imagination go wild. http://www.infinitybookreview.blogspo... Probably one of my favorites in the series so far. I absolutely love this series! A little slow moving in the beginning, and certainly depressing, but who can argue with Rowling\\'s incredible plot weavings? 3.5 heartbreaking stars Rowling connects every single detail efficiently..I can\\'t quite nail the pattern of Rowling\\'s writing.. Surprises in every single book.. Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle\\'s reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, \\'Tom\\'? First two books were relaxed, in the third, the story was heating up, voldemort rose in fourth, Harry\\'s true first fight in fifth, preparation for second battle in sixth..(like being familiar with voldemort ..knowing his weak points...) And the final and second battle in seventh..(as in revelations in Bible, the second coming or the final battle..) Rowling has planned it well.. Though I understand it limitedly.. A few thoughts: In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination. Oblivious reasons are sometimes scarier then obvious ones.. That\\'s not unicorn hair, Hagrid? \"Oh, yeah,\" said Hagrid indifferently. Gets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches an\\' stuff in the forest, yeh know ... But my dear chap, do you know how much that\\'s worth? \"I use it fer bindin\\' on bandages an stuff if a creature gets in jured,\" said Hagrid, shrugging. \"It\\'s dead useful. very strong.\" Happened after Aragog\\'s burial.. This is why I love hagrid\\'s character.. Been laughing all the way through Aragog\\'s burial! sang Slughorn plaintively. \"They laid him to rest with his hat inside out. And his wand snapped in two, which was sad.\" terrible,\" Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply. This is my favorite portion in this book..DSO FUNNY!! \"You\\'d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,\" said Harry. It would be a very brave and noble thing to do. Some things happen and you just have to wait and take it slow to undo the misshapen or strengthen the good. am afraid,\\' she went on, \\'that the nag - I\\'m sorry, the centaur - knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him - one Seer to another - had he not, too, sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!\\' I wish there was professor trelawny and firenzes conversation in the book..I loved those very much! Your blood is worth more than mine. How humble of Dumbledore.. Wish I could be as humble and caring as dumbledore. Selfless,all the way.. \\'Yeah, that fits,\\' said Harry. \\'He\\'d play up the pureblood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them ... he\\'s just like Voldemort. Pureblood mother, Muggie father ... ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name - Lard Voldemort - the HalfBlood Prince - how could Dumbledore have missed -?\\' The most vital portion which led to the heading of the book. This was amazing! Phenomenal! The ending really broke my heart. Can\\'t wait to read the next one!! i wish i could rate it more than just five out of five... i saw this somewhere... \"That moment when you finish a book, look around, and realize that everyone is just carrying on with their lives as though you didn\\'t just experience emotional trauma at the hands of a paperback.\" And this makes so much sense right now... OK. I\\'m prepared to admit I\\'ve read it. As someone once said about Jeffrey Archer novels, it\\'s rather like a packet of stale chips. You keep taking them out and eating them, hoping that the ones at the bottom are little better. But they\\'re not. After a while, you notice that the bag is empty, and you feel rather disgusted with yourself. She claims the whole story was planned from the beginning. Yeah, right. Though, to be fair, she\\'s in good company; Proust said something similar about A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu. He didn\\'t come across as very credible either. If you still don\\'t believe me about the links between Proust and Potter, look here. If that doesn\\'t convince you, I give up. There\\'s such a thing as being too sceptical for your own good. Wow. It was worth growing up to appreciate this book fully. Slughorn is amazing, Harry (aka Roonil Wazlib) is amazing and Dumbledore is... sob, sob. I wonder if Lily Evans was so great at potions because Severus was and he let her cheat, or if they shared this passion. WHYYYY? I was using this to de-stress between exams and you had to do this to me. I\\'m more stressed than I was before, how could you, J.K.Rowling? t was so unexpected and I hate Snape so much right now  even though I\\'m pretty sure the next book will redeem him   and I\\'m so sorry for Draco, he\\'s too young for this awful shit. And my boy, Harry James Potter was so determined at the end of the book, I could hear bad-ass songs accompanying him as he walked. ut really why did she kill Dumbledore? hy does she have to kill every father figure Harry ever has? et the boy be happy for once. nd that thing with Ginny, yikes. y girl Ginny can totally take care of herself, doesn\\'t need you to break up with her, Harry Pottahhhh. One of the best of the series behind Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows. Excellent, unpredictable, and very well done. Great character development. Interesting view into Voldemort. Loved this book and love reading it again and again! Can you marry a book? Because I want to marry this one! The three stages of reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince : 1)Laugh so hard I couldn\\'t breath 2) Read maniacally 3) Ugly cry and feelings that life is over My current state: I AM AFRAID FOR EVERYONE\\'S FUTURE RIGHT NOW! (Spoiler alert!) So I don\\'t really understand this, but the first couple of times I read this, I didn\\'t cry at all when Dumbledore died. The first time I was shocked and saddened, but, very strangely for me, didn\\'t cry. But now that I\\'ve read the 7th book and know that he was going to die anyways, I\\'ve been bawling. Strange, yes? This one is actually happy -I mean, besides the annual big-huge-fight- and that\\'s very nice, especially since the 7th book is so...dreary, shall we say? There are parts that are...not exactly scary, more like very tense. And they make me shiver even though its 75 degrees outside: specifically, the chapter \"The Cave\". Also, Harry and Ginny! So cute! This is when Rowling really focused on the finish. No more f-ing around. This woman had a job to do. In a way, I was glad the sports championships, tournaments and other silly asides were done with. On the other hand, the story became singleminded in scope. As readers we were no longer inhabiting the world of Harry Potter, we were now on a quest. As much as I\\'ve complained about those silly asides, I realized after finishing this book (and especially after the next one) that I missed them. Diversions done well are a nice relief and can add so much depth to story and character. If there is something to be said about the story and character of Harry Potter, it\\'s that our boy is all growed up. Book #6 is a far cry from #1. A big and important step is taken in the The Half-Blood Prince. Rowling shows she is not afraid to kill off her most precious babies. Some would say the series had to end at some point and that the killings were not so bold. Ah, but many a publishing and movie executive would disagree and cry out, \"Why?! Why kill the cash cow?!?!\" Well, she did. Finally Rowling did kill it. She brought this whole satisfying series to an end, and this is its beginning. For the love of Christ, we\\'re almost done reading these to our kids. This one was actually much better than it\\'s crappy predecessor. Some cool revelations about the big baddie and some sweet-ass wizard battles. Plus, Snape! Rowling wasn\\'t afraid to kill off main characters, either, though it was unavoidable and kind of predictable mostly because other kids keep ruining the story for us. On the negative side, the pacing is off, all the interesting characters are completely left out and even Ron and Hermione just sort of simper around whining a lot. I\\'d Crucio those two into oblivion. Gradually, I think these books got worse and worse. I felt like Rowling lost track of her own characters. EDIT: Upon actually reading the book again, and finishing it all the way this time, I can say that I really didn\\'t mind it. Although I still don\\'t care much for the way Rowling\\'s characters began to act, I did enjoy this book. I feel betrayed!!! This will no doubt be the root of all my trust issues... ** spoiler alert ** One of my top 3 Harry Potter books, but I cried when Dumbledore died. Poor thing. Second read: Still fantastic, obviously. The plot is pretty long and drawn out with nothing happening for a while but Rowling JUST picks it up in exactly the right spot before it begins to get boring. Her brilliance in writing really shows how she can carry 500+ pages with very little excitement and still make it a page turner. The ending really makes the book where all the hints and mysteries comes together in such a perfect way where so many characters change and so much happens, I felt like I read the last 100 pages in five minutes I just couldn\\'t stop. First read: Another fantastic addition in the HP series. Unbridled intensity, plot developments galore, brilliant characters and dialogue, strange and amazing environments...all standard HP brilliance. This book, however, did suffer from just too much shallow teen romance, re-hashing the same stereotypical gendered bullshit of boys being dumb and girls crying all the time that never happens in real life. There was too much dating early and mid book and it just seemed like filler. I understand it fits in their development as teenagers...but it could have been done a lot better. Other than that the book was great and, obviously, a great addition to the series. MY FAVORITE FROM THE WHOLE SERIES. DRACO IS AMAZING OK. 11/10/10 - This one is so heavy, that I quite appreciated the light-heartedness of the hormone stuff. I like how the lovey-dovey stuff is kinda slowly been building up. I adore Ron and Hermione together. I like Ginny and Harry together. I loved the scene at the end with Fleur in the hospital wing. I loved Luna and I want to hear more about Neville. I find at the end of this one, I don\\'t have a whole lot to say about it. I liked it of course, but mostly I\\'m just anxious to get to the last one. I\\'ve only read it once and honestly, I kinda rushed through it. 12/26/12 - This was my first read-aloud of this book. I don\\'t remember if the end choked me up this much before, but it definitely did this time. I had a hard time getting through it! My Little was a little sad at the top of the astronomy tower too, but the aftermath didn\\'t seem to bother her as much. We immediately started Deathly Hallows. 7/8/16 - Still loved it. Dumbledore died. :( Out of the characters he was one of my favorites. If he hadn\\'t died I might have added another star to my rating. I really don\\'t enjoy this series though I still carried on reading it anyway, it\\'s a well written book there\\'s nothing wrong with it in that respect, it\\'s just it\\'s not the book for me. Sorry only 1 star off me. I\\'m so miserable right now, I have been crying for fifteen minutes, and I feel like a little kid who has just grown up all at once. I love these books more than words can express. Christmas break is the perfect time to read this sort of thing (especially since I also had to re-read the fifth book to refresh my memory). These terrible obsessions can\\'t possibly be quenched somewhat and then put to rest during regular working days, oh no. Holidays are the only time for it, and only if you don\\'t have much else planned. This is by far my favourite harry potter book! I love it way too much! I\\'ve cried so hard! ombuldore dying just broke my heart A lot happen in this book, new amazing spells like Sectunsempra just for enemies and more! Now, after Ive read this book again, now that Im twenty years old I just feel pity for Draco, I think all he\\'s ever done it\\'s to make his father proud but Lucious is just a snake sun of a bitch who desn\\'t give a fuck for his son. Because if I was him, I would hide my son from the shadow of the dark one. bout Snape,  I know how this ends! ut I can\\'t help myself from hating him in this book. I liked this because of Snape and all those realizations XD Gosh it\\'s been a long time I really enjoyed this book compared to book five in the series. I think it mainly had to do with the fact that Harry wasn\\'t being a jerk to his friends anymore, Dumbledore was an active part of his life again, Ron and Hermoine started to show their feelings for each other, and Ginny and Harry finally hooked up (as well as Tonks and Lupin) There was a lot of love and action in this book to keep the pages turning. It was also very interesting to see Voldemort more as a person in the memories than a snake-like creature-man. Kind of humanized him a bit so it feels like Harry has a chance. I remember crying my eyes out the first time I read it when Dumbledore died, but I think with how many times I\\'ve seen the movie and knew it was coming, I didn\\'t get as emotional. This is probably my favorite Harry Potter books so far, aside from the first one. I liked it, but it wasn\\'t as exiting as the others. My least favorite of the series. RE-READ: Half-Blood Prince was not my favorite book when I first read it in high school, but as a shiny thirty-something adult, I feel like I appreciated it more this time. I still love Draco\\'s arc and the connection he builds with Moaning Myrtle. I love the information we get about Tom Riddle and how he came to be the villain he is. I loved seeing more of Dumbledore and Harry. I loved that Grawp was at Dumbledore\\'s funeral in a close approximation of a suit. I love how we finally got Remus and Tonks, which was a pairing I didn\\'t even know I wanted until it happened. I even love the silliness and the evolution of teenage love/relationships (Ron/Lavender, the disaster that was Hermione/Cormac, and Harry/Ginny.) Inferi are creepy and terrifying. Fenrir Greyback is creepy and terrifying. Dumbledore\\'s death still crushes me every time. WAAAH. Six down, one to go. Maybe I can accomplish the goal of finishing them all before the end of this year? I like this one a lot, nearly as much as OOtP. I do like that she allowed them one last moment of relative levity before the final fight. However, the Harry/Ginny romancin\\' leaves me a little cold, simply because she\\'s been such a bit part up until about half-way through this book. I like her - a lot - and I get why Harry would too. However, she\\'s not been on-screen enough for me to form an actual attachment to, and so it seems somewhat rushed. But it\\'s not a huge complaint! Depressing but great. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was amazing! J.K. Rowling is such a talented author! She breathes new light onto both Voldemort and Snape and you learn more about them (more about Voldemort than Snape). The love stories in this book were definately a nice addition in the more serious atmosphere. Ron was, as always, the comical relief. I really enjoyed seeing Fred and George\\'s shop. That was a great detail to the series that I think every reader was definately waiting for. Everything with Voldemort gets more complicated as you read this book though. Interesting but complicated. It\\'s a good complicated though. You can still understand everything but the world of Harry Potter is definately well-thought out. I LOVED this book. I bought it as soon as it came out and read it all in one day/night. Luckily I didn\\'t have to work the next day.  was soo upset that Dumbledore died. ut like most people I knew there had to be a reason why Snape killed him.  just couldn\\'t accept that Snape was a traitor. Snape. Snape. Severus Snape. Master at potions? Harry?? Okay. He finds a book filled with different directions and new spells. This helps him become a favorite of the new Potions teacher. Of course, Hermione is jealous. Ron is his usual mad self. It is another adventure at Hogwarts. Be prepared for some tears. ** spoiler alert ** Dumbledore\\'s death was very obvious with the amount of time Rowling took in this book to humanize him. Though Snape being the Half-Blood Prince was a surprise; I thought it would be Voldemort even though I thought it odd that he would proudly call himself a half-blood. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. I find it difficult to give a critical review on a series of books that is so ingrained into my young life that if I had not read these books, I would honestly not be who I am today. I have read this book 5-7 times now and it will be a book I go back to again and again over the years of my life. I will always love Harry and his friends. I love all the Harry Potter books. It is a bad idea to read the last part of this book when you\\'re feeling down. Like, seriously, it is a very bad idea, even if you know what\\'s gonna happen. I read this thing non-stop until I finished it. A lot of filler with a killer ending, Half-Blood Prince is a perfectly okay instalment in the Harry Potter series. In the wake of the villainous Lord Voldemort\\'s return to power, 16 year-old Harry returns to wizard school, studies Voldemort\\'s past, suspects a peer of plotting evil, and engages in the usual amount of magical shenanigans. This is the first book where Voldemort\\'s evil intentions are out in the open, the wizarding community is actively bracing for war, and Harry understands his role as the only one capable of defeating Voldemort. Though Harry story is still confined to his boarding school, in this book we finally get a sense of what is really at stake in the battle against Voldemort. Half-Blood Prince includes a decent amount of school magic fun and plenty of humorous teen romance, though the book doesn\\'t exactly have a driving, complex plot. Apart from a couple of isolated, ineffective attacks, there isn\\'t much menace behind the antagonist\\'s plot. Most of the tension comes from the characters hearing about a growing stream of deaths and disappearances via the newspaper. Even the Half-Blood Prince plot (which ought to be of vital importance, considering that it is in the title) turns out to be not all that relevant to the overall story. Nonetheless, it\\'s enjoyable when Harry deviously succeeds in Potions class by following the Half-Blood Prince\\'s handwritten instructions in an old textbook, and disturbing when the Prince entices Harry into using a dark curse. Another of my favourite sequences is when Harry uses a luck potion to convince one of his professors to divulge a shameful memory. However, like all the longer Harry Potter books there\\'s a fair amount of padding. Some of the padding comes from needless repetitions. For example, Harry notices his arch rival Draco Malfoy acting suspiciously in a Darks Arts shop and theorises Draco has become initiated as one of Voldemort\\'s followers. He relays his suspicions to everyone who will listen in many separate scenes - though no one believes him. These repetitive discussions add nothing new to Harry\\'s theory, they aren\\'t plot progression, they\\'re redundant. The same thing happens when Harry suspects his teacher Professor Snape of aiding Draco - Harry once again repeats his suspicions to multiple people in separate scenes, convinces no one and generally just wastes his (and the reader\\'s) time. Harry\\'s prolonged investigation into Draco Malfoy\\'s activities is composed of endless, failed attempts that make Harry look incredibly incompetent. In the earlier books Harry was quite clever and capable, but he seems to get progressively more inept with each book. His ineptitude successfully stretches out the weak central plot to the required length, but at the expense of transforming the main character into a total ignoramus. Another source of padding involves the usual assortment of subplots which vary immensely in how interesting they are. I personally found the Quidditch subplot to be tiresome and honestly wish J.K. Rowling had retired the sport a couple of books ago. Rowling does her best to make it fresh and different, but never fully succeeds. Your mileage will vary, but I was equally underwhelmed by subplots like Tonk\\'s deflated mood and Professor Snape\\'s transfer out of the Potions classroom. Some padding comes from Rowling surrounding interesting moments with too much extraneous filler. For example, when Dumbledore first takes Harry into a memory to study Voldemort\\'s past, we spend several pages following the completely random character Bob Ogden before getting to the point. Actually, we don\\'t ever really get to the point because although the mildly interesting memory shows Voldemort\\'s family in an unexpected light, it doesn\\'t exactly contain any super-crucial information. Dumbledore could easily convey his theory about Voldemort much more succinctly instead of drawing it out all year via lengthy trips down memory lane. Having written all this, the final chapters of this book work wonderfully as fantasy spectacle and action scene. The final confrontation also advances the series\\' overall conflict and changes everything going into the final instalment. So it\\'s all incredibly frustrating when Harry and Dumbledore\\'s efforts are revealed to have been for nothing. At the end of the day, I think Half-Blood Prince is moderately enjoyable, but unfortunately overlong, repetitive and ultimately futile. This is a great series. It\\'s one that I (like everyone else) fell in love with. I will admit there are all sorts of problems with plot holes, limited character development, and the like, but this world is enchanting and captivating. It sucks you in and you find you don\\'t care about all those details. I had a slow start with this book because I went on vacation and couldn\\'t take it with me. I think so far this has been the saddest book for me but at the same time it\\'s incredibly revealing. Now I can\\'t wait to read the last one. I was a sobbing mess at the end of this one. Stop looking at reviews and read this series. Seriously, what are you still doing here? Read it! Unlike earlier books in the series, which I\\'ve re-read many times (I used to re-read them while waiting for the later books to come out), this was the first time I\\'d revisited Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince since I finished the series. It\\'s a very different experience, reading this book now that I know how the whole epic conflict with Voldemort works out, than my relatively-unspoiled first reading. (At the time, there were rumors that a major character died; I had my theories but scrupulously avoided any media where spoilers might lurk, and I read the whole book in two days on the day of release, so I got to enjoy, er, experience the surprise.) This second time through, knowing what\\'s coming, it strikes me that Book Six is actually very bittersweet. Half-Blood Prince isn\\'t as dark and brooding as the preceding book, Order of the Phoenix. Now that Dolores Umbridge is gone, Hogwarts is a bright, happy place again. Now that the O.W.Ls (standardized testing for wizard students) is behind them, Harry and his friends seem to enjoy their classes more; they are less pressured, more leisurely. They find time for romance, for quidditch, for weekends in Hogsmeade, for learning how to apparate. Harry, who was furious at being ignored by Dumbledore in Order of the Phoenix, is back on good terms with the headmaster again: he\\'s even singled out for special one-on-one lessons aimed to help him defeat Voldemort when the time comes. Book Six is the calm before the storm. Outside of Hogwarts, terrible things are happening now that Voldemort is back -- the Daily Prophet is always full of stories of kidnappings, murders, and other tragedies that show the Dark Lord is gaining ground -- and Harry and the others are aware of these miseries but insulated from them. In these dark times more than every before, Hogwarts is a haven, a refuge, a bubble. Dumbledore is the only wizard Voldemort fears, and so Dumbledore\\'s school is the safest place to be. nowing now that this is Harry\\'s last year at Hogwarts (rather than the anticipated 7th year), I think it\\'s kind of lovely that it was generally such a nice one: that he got to be the Quidditch team captain, that he finally had a potions teacher he could stand, that Gryffindor won the Quidditch cup, and Harry and Ginny got to enjoy a few weeks of happiness. Of course that idyllic calm can\\'t last, and the conclusion is meant to set up the final book, Deathly Hallows. While it\\'s not a cliffhanger in the traditional sense, the end of Half-Blood Prince leaves a lot more open questions than the relatively self-contained plot of the other books in the series. Again, knowing what is coming changed my perspective on the ending. The first time I read it, I was stunned and horrified, ot only by Dumbledore\\'s death but also by Snape\\'s apparent betrayal, but this time, I approached the final chapters with a strong sense of inevitability. Random Spoilery Thought: s I\\'ve been making my way through Litchick\\'s Epic Harry Potter Group Read (which has now been going on since before Thanksgiving), I\\'ve been thinking all along that Snape is so horrible, more horrible than I remembered, so horrible that the big reveal at the end of Deathly Hallows falls flat because it isn\\'t enough to redeem such a nasty character.  still kind of feel that way, but in retrospect I think the part of Half-Blood Prince where Snape gives Harry Saturday detentions after Harry and Malfoy duel is a bit of a give-away. etention is a really lenient punishment for almost murdering someone, and I should have been much more suspicious of that at the time. If you haven\\'t read this book, don\\'t even attempt to read this review. Honestly, you\\'re just going to regret doing so. It\\'s been two years since I read this for the first time. Yes, two years separated tte moment in which I finished book 5 and started book 6. Now, don\\'t ask me why because I don\\'t know. This is a book I particularly like. Well, duh, I like all the HP books, but I mean this is one of my favourite HP books. The reasons are plenty, so I will mention only one: Tom Riddle, or as we knew him from the beginning of this series, Lord Voldemort. From the moment I knew he was Harry\\'s enemy and the one who murdered his parents, a certain curiosity to know why he had done that and to know more about his past was born, yet we didn\\'t fully understand him till this book, in which he was finally given a backstory. And what a backstory it was. One would be even more afraid of him after getting to know bits of his past, and indeed, I was, but I was more intrigued by his character than afraid of him. As for the... death in this book (you know which one I\\'m talking about)... I don\\'t know if it\\'s the same for you as it is with me, but I found it more shocking than sad. I think that\\'s because of all the things happeing around. There were so many surprises revealed, and the book only got more and more intense. But of course, Dumbledore isn\\'t really gone if there are still loyal people to him, isn\\'t that true? What I sure will miss are his words of wisdom, some of which I carry with me as if they were a treasure, like this one I took from this book: It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. And with reason I did. I mean, how true is that? Now I will reread the last book. I know what expects me is lots of darkness, death, and even more surprised than the ones revealed previously in the series. I am not prepared, but I will continue as Harry did with the task of the Horcruxes. Bought for Myself Overall Rating: 5.00 + Series Rating: 5.00 + NOTE: June 26, 2011 marks my \"Gosh I don\\'t know how many times I have read this book\" annual Re-Read! I will be changing all my ratings of this series to 5 because I have come to the conclusion that if I can re-read them this many times they are worthy of a 5! What I Loved: This book I think is the one Harry finally starts to grow up a little though he is still way to angry for my taste. It has been a long time since I was 16 so maybe that is normal with all the loss that he has had in his life. I loved how they kind of split up the team for a bit so they could understand how important they were to each other. Also, I like the blossoming of young love that happened in this book because if you aren\\'t fighting for love and hope then what is the point. Loved the Weasley twins as always! They are the right amount of lightness that is needed in dark times! Just my thoughts: This isn\\'t my favorite book in the series--never has been. To be honest, there are times when I think Malfoy is growing up more than Harry. I don\\'t like Malfoy but his journey has kind of been the flip side of Harry\\'s all along. Ron and Hermoine again to me are the best friends anyone can have. They put up with so much from Harry and until the very last of the book I don\\'t think he realizes how lucky he really is. Why I gave it a 5+: After re-reading this book so many times, I have decided that all the growing pains were necessary to lead up to the last book in the series. The stuff I didn\\'t like had to do mostly with Harry---his anger, especially after the last book, really kind of didn\\'t work for me. Also, don\\'t like how he constantly questions Dumbledors thoughts on Snape. Still a really great book though. What I read/listened to this time around (I usually do a listen/read combo--sometimes not): 2009: HC US 2010: HC US 2011: HC US/Audiobook US 2012: HC US/Audiobook US 2013: Ebook US/Audiobook US 07/16/2013 2014: Ebook US/Audiobook UK Jun 27, 2014 2015: Ebook UK 2016: Ebook UK/Hardcover UK/Audiobook UK 2017: Ebook UK/Audibook UK Love it! i enjoyed reading this book. i was thrilled all throughout the book. Actual rating: 4.5 Damn, Harry Potter is getting darker and has more romance in each book progressively... This one\\'s kinda creepy though and saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad, cause spoilers ;) I didn\\'t much care for this one most of the way through. Thought it had a really slow start. Now, I see that\\'s because it\\'s a definite precursor for the last one. First of the HP books to end on a cliffhanger. The last 250 pages or so were spectacular. Kept me up reading until 4:30 in the morning. Positively brilliant stuff. Why, oh why? I can\\'t stop crying! I should give this book one star because of my broken heart. This is by far my favorite Harry Potter book. The whole series is phenomenal, OBVIOUSLY, but this book was my absolute favorite to read. I\\'m looking forward to rereading it honestly! It was heartbreaking and thrilling at the same time.. My favorite book among the Harry Potter Series (I think). I was VERY surprised when I read it the first time. Never imagined Harry ending up with Ginny. But it\\'s an amazing book overall. Source: I own multiple copies of this book. Cost: Unknown Title:  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Series:  Harry Potter #6 Author:  JK Rowling Overall Rating:  5 stars I am not okay. This book genuinely has broken my heart, I can tell where the saddest parts are in my copy as the pages are literally tear stained. Growing up, I read and re-read this whole series multiple times, and I can literally tell you every detail in every book, but every single time, it breaks my heart. I\\'m not okay with this series, especially being slightly sleep deprived as I read this book. I think this book makes you feel kind of okay despite how sad the world around it is, there is an undercurrent of sadness and grimness, but there is also humour and a glimmer of hope and it kind of makes you feel like everything will be okay then WHAM. The thing that shall not be named happens. Which wasn\\'t very nice JK. Thank you. word count: 168,923 rating: far better than I remember I\\'ve re-read most of Harry Potter books several times, but the last two... Well, they were much darker and I\\'m squeamish, especially when it comes to things I\\'m so emotionally invested in. So when I picked up the 6th book I wasn\\'t so sure I want to read it at all. Boy, was I wrong. It was good. Very good. Rowling got quite excellent in writing throughout the years. Those logical mistakes we find in the first books are gradually fewer and fewer until we end up with a book that at first sight doesn\\'t bother us at all (yes, if you\\'re mean you can find something to complain about, that\\'s always possible, but that doesn\\'t mean much). About the tone: It\\'s been gradually changing. In the fifth book we get a mix of focus on school and Voldemort with a big, dark \\'umph\\' at the end which tells us all bets are off. In the Half Blood Prince lessons and school stuff we grew to love are clearly secondary; we said good bye to them when Fred and George left the school (at least that\\'s how I feel). Now our characters are still at Hogwarts, but lessons, quidditch games and feasts are barely mentioned in the passing - they\\'re not the point. That shift is very clear. Now Harry is preparing for the grand finale. Is that a good thing? Yes, it\\'s great for the whole story, even if it\\'s less \\'fun\\'. You\\'ve got to understand that I\\'ve read all of it before, so there was no sense of novelty to things Harry finds out. Less stress, but also less excitement. But the first time I read it... it was nerve-racking. Harry is a bit more grown up; he\\'s still prone to some teen behaviours, but far, far less than in the Order of the Phoenix. Characters are developing and getting more and more multidimensional (Dumbledore, Herione, Ron... everyone, even those on the side of evil, like the Malfoys). I love that growing complexity. That things aren\\'t black and white, simple. In LOTR you have orcs, creatures utterly dispensable, there\\'s no gravitas to killing them. It\\'s a no-brainer. In HP we\\'re dealing with people, and people are much more complex. Value of life is much more difficult to estimate. People aren\\'t simply divided into good and bad, there\\'s so much more to the way they choose to act! And Rowling is brilliant in showing it. Actually, Rowling is brilliant. Period. The effortless way in which she conveys thing deserves the highest respect. There\\'s so much \\'showing\\' other authors should freaking study her writing. I didn\\'t notice it at first, it just happens, it took some conscious effort on my side to see it. That\\'s how engrossed you are in the story. I love it. I love the ending, I love reaction of members of the Order of the Phoenix to the news, I love Luna and Neville (Rowling introduces so many different types of people with varying qualities that are worth respect! ), I love the Ron-Hermione relationship that starts changing, I love how dangerous using spells you don\\'t really know is, how dangers of magic are presented. I love the teachers, the students, the ministry of magic (cause aren\\'t all the politicians speckled with various stinky, shitty things? ), I love how cold and calm becomes Harry\\'s reaction to it... I love a lot of things I\\'m unable to name at this time. Including the action scenes! It would be so easy to fuck up the fights, and yet they are dynamic and exciting. Wow. Just wow. Re-reading that book helped me admire Rowling even more. I am not okay. (Also, WHERE THE HECK IS NEVILLE.) Review of entire series to follow on my blog (once I finish the series, that is). I enjoyed this even more on the re-read. In some ways it is a break from all the dark stuff, but it still permeates the book. The ending is terribly sad too. I think the invention of Felix Felicis is really great - I love how that all plays out. This series only gets better as you reread it, honestly. LOVED IT, CRIED OVER IT, LAUGHED OVER IT, AND HUGGED IT! THE FEELS HAVE BEEN PRETTY STRONG IN THIS ONE AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WILL HAPPEN (EVEN IF I KNOW SOME SPOILERS) IN THE LAST BOOK- HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS. I first read this when I was a child, and the whole series is a definite 5 for me. I grew up with this. Heck, my parents loved it so much we used to watch the movies together. It just gets darker and darker... And this book is the beginning of the end! What a mystery. Love you Queen Rowling xo I can\\'t even begin to review this book except to say it doesn\\'t matter how much I know, it\\'s always a devastating read. There are always tears. Awesome...and I think I shed a few tears at the end. Poor Dumbledore. Third time through and I still cried at the end. And enjoyed the whole thing no end (except for the Ron and Hermione arc - but it works for the age group for which it is intended). Although I am pleased that the time with the Dursleys has been cut drastically short in the later books, it seems to have been replaced by Harry\\'s bad-temper at being misunderstood and insistence on investigating problems that no one else agrees is a problem. That is not to say that he might not be right, but the persistence of the bad-temper and \"misunderstood\" attitude puts me distinctly in sympathy with Sirus Black\\'s ancestor\\'s portrait in the last book when he acidly pointed out how those attitudes are common and boring in the young. That aside, I\\'m enjoying this book just as much as the others ... at about chapter 10. As always, I\\'m still amazed at how little I remember of the plot, whether small points or large ... UPDATE Ok, seriously. I\\'m on chapter 26, on the trail of the horucrux with Harry and Dumbledore. How can I NOT remember one thing about this? On the other hand, I can testify that it is a very suspenseful book, well written ... and one I can\\'t stop listening to... FINAL - SPOILERS INCLUDED *sniffle* Ok, I have finished. id remember that Dumbledore died.  did remember that somehow the book ended with all fans violently arguing about whether Snape was good or evil ... and that I adamantly maintained that Dumbledore was asking Snape to kill him, which Snape didn\\'t want to do. I think the reason I tended to forget the end of this book was that I got this battle confused with the bigger battle at the end of The Deathly Hallows. Well only time will tell that, as I have requested the audio version of Deathly Hallows but am waiting in line. The last movie must have made many more people than me revisit the audio versions. What a wonderful, satisfying book. Very dark, of course, but it would have to be because Harry must be left with nothing between him and Voldemort for the final reckoning. And that can\\'t happen without losing loved ones along the way. At least not in classic stories it can\\'t. Actual Rating: 3.5 Stars It seems I can\\'t seem to love these books as much as I want to. It was a good book - very well thought out and executed, yet it wasn\\'t enough for me to call it exceptional. I think with this book, it was more of a personal problem for me. I love romance books - don\\'t get me wrong - but this one tested my limits. I can handle a MAX of 2 relationships at one time (and I\\'d prefer only one of them to be a major plot point). There was just too much sexual tension and angst for me. e had Bill and Fleur in the beginning, and they were fine. on and Hermoine have their big over-arching romance going on this entire series.  loved the lead up to it from all the previous books, with the little moments of jealousy and protectiveness. owever, their relationship in this book had too much tension, drama, and pettiness to be enjoyable for me.  feel like Harry and Ginny\\'s relationship didn\\'t have enough lead-up towards it - at least from Harry\\'s perspective. t was basically Harry asking Ginny to join him/Ron and Hermoine a couple times and feeling disappointed when he was rejected (because of Dean). nd then there was one moment of contact where he had butterfly-like feelings. his all would be fine if Ginny was some random girl, but Ginny is a friend - someone Harry has known for a long time. t would have been nice to have the transition from friendship to relationship fleshed out a little more. t was just too immediate. nd then the ending where Harry was like: \"We can\\'t be together. t\\'s too dangerous.\" Eye roll.  Could that be anymore cliche and annoying?  didn\\'t see him tell Ron and Hermoine that they had to stop being friends. gh. nd then there\\'s Tonks and Lupin. his one was just randomly thrown in there. All these relationships would have been fine if they weren\\'t all thrown in/peaking in the same book. It was too much for one book, in my opinion, and would have been better if they were spread out over the series. In fact, I was talking about the horcruxes with a friend while reading this, wondering what they were. I was over half-way through the book, so she was surprised that they weren\\'t explained already and asked me: What has been going on in the book then? The answer: Nothing. Just relationship drama. The actual plot was basically at a stand still for the first half of the book. That being said, the second half of the book was great. The idea of horcruxes is seriously cool, and it\\'s pretty awesome seeing Tom Riddle\\'s story. In this book, we got to see Dumbledore in a more human light - not just the great, untouchable wizard. He was funny and quirky and simply a delight. His adventure with Harry was super fun. And by fun, I mean creepy. And then...THE ENDING. HOLY CRAP. THAT PLOT TWIST. aving lived for 18 years without reading the series, things are bound to get spoiled. o unfortunately, I already know that Snape turns out to be a good guy. t kind of sucks, but I\\'m still excited to see the reasoning behind his actions. nd I definitely did NOT expect Snape to be the one to kill Dumbledore. Ahh. The ending was just so action packed and climatic. Just awesome. Totally left me pumped for the finale. Half-Blood Prince is arguably one of the best entries of this series. The best thing about it that I love is the insight in Tom Riddle\\'s past. It was dark stuff and it personified Voldemort instead of just keeping him a generic evil guy. There was a lot of little stuff that I didn\\'t remember reading before, which made me really glad that I chose to reread these books. On to the last one now. You\\'ll never be gone as long as we\\'re here. Read my review of the entire series here. t\\'s even sadder when you read it without the knowledge that Dumbledore\\'s death was planned the whole time , which was how the readers inevitably read it, barring any inconvenient spoilers. Very sad. This one was great, a different feel on the whole than the other books. I felt like this one was geared more toward girls because of the relationships. This one felt like more of a page turner than the first 5. Rating: 5 stars. I really liked this book too. It\\'s my second favorite of the series. Rowling kept me flipping pages through the entire novel. My favourite of the series, for many many reasons, not just because I\\'m a ginormous Draco fan. It\\'s difficult to write a review for this book. The first three-quarters of the book could be renamed \"Harry Potter and Normal Life Inside of Hogwarts.\" Without something like the opening of the Chamber of Secrets or the TriWizard Tournament to give the plot a driving force, we spend a lot of time with Harry, Ron and Hermione in class, figuring out their love lives and worrying about Voldemort -- but in way that\\'s not immediate or dangerous. But the ending! Oh, the ending! ...and I\\'m not so much of a jerk to spoil the ending at all. In this book, Harry is finally leaving boyhood behind and becoming a man. It\\'s uncomfortable for him and sometimes uncomfortable for the readers. His friends aren\\'t following him blindly any more, intent on being equals and not merely sidekicks. Everyone makes ridiculously stupid decisions and act like jerks about it. But it\\'s all okay, because it feels real. People are jerks, friends fight, people grow up and apart and they continue to struggle onward. I really am at a complete loss as to why I didn\\'t read these books earlier. They are one of my all-time favorite series\\' even though this book\\'s ending just broke my heart.  realize that most amazing books all have a big sacrifice aka some major IMPORTANT character who has a piece of my heart just goes and DIES  but that doesn\\'t mean I have to like it. More to come after I read the final book - I\\'m immensely sad just think about how it\\'s the LAST book :( So, I wrote a review for this when I read it but accidentally deleted a whole bunch of reviews when I was reorganizing my shelves... So I guess I just have to read them all again so I can give accurate reviews :D From my re-read of this series, I have determined that this is my least favorite Harry Potter book. We\\'ll have to see if that still stands once I\\'ve read Deathly Hallows again, as its been so long I don\\'t remember much from it. Unfortunately, I can\\'t really figure out why I didn\\'t like this one as much. I think maybe because it has less humor, and less exciting little side stories? I\\'m really not sure. It just doesn\\'t have quite the same spark as the previous novels. In this book we learn about Horcruxes through Harry\\'s lessons with Dumbledore. Harry is made captain of the Quidditch team, and the teen romances play a much larger role. Draco is up to something; Harry thinks he is a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione don\\'t believe him. The Half-Blood Prince and Harry\\'s potions book obviously play a large role, and his identity is finally revealed at the end. We learn the backstory for Voldemort as well. This is I think the darkest HP book, although the last book in the series comes a close second. I have not read this series in ages and therefore I think forgot a lot of the major plot points that are necessary for the final book in the series. The main characters are again Harry, Ron and Hermione and this is the first book in which they are seriously thinking about having a relationship. There is some serious tension between Ron and Hermione as they both clearly have feelings for each other but are reluctant to say anything to the other. The other main thing affecting the story is Voldemort\\'s rise and Dumbledore\\'s plan for Harry which drives the whole book. The secondary characters include the other Hogwarts teachers and pupils and the Order. Ginny comes into her own in this book and is a fantastic character. And for the first time Draco Malfoy seems to be a real threat. The storyline is excellent and the pacing is great, full of tension all the way through leading to an almost shock ending (if I hadn\\'t read the book before). I am already reading the last book in the series but still appreciate all the little bits about this book. 4.5 stars In no way do I diss Harry Potter, but I must say that I was really disappointed by the length of this book. Read oon the blog! Okay before you guys say anything let me make one thing clear. I know that the whole world has read this book and nobody would even want a review for something this awesome but you see, I have to do it. I love this series and it\\'s not going away from me without at least a review. So I started reading this series three months ago (yeah yeah I am stupid whatever). I was never actually interested in reading the books. I had seen all first five movies and half of the sixth one when I realised that I had to read the books to really grasp it all. And so it began. The end of my normal life but the beginning of one so much more cooler. As I read on I realised how stupid I had been for not even thinking of reading it when the HP books were all around me because my whole class had read it and Beez was annoyed with me reading it now! when everything was over, the books, the movies, everything but I still read on and now I am obsessed. This book is great. Everything from character building to the plot is perfect! I wish J.K.Rowling would come to me personally and smack my face for not having read this earlier. If someone out there has still not read it, then read it, from the first book to the last and trust me you will never ever regret having read it. It\\'s a fantasy that is out of any of our imagination! I love how finally we find out Voldemort\\'s weaknesses and the ending is just fabulous, I was sobbing for half an hour after the book was over and also laughing hysterically when I remembered all the punch lines that were in the book. I rate it a 5 on 5. The best thing that has ever happened to me. I am officially a potterhead! Lots of love and pasta, Raven ** spoiler alert ** Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is by far my favorite book outside in and outside of the Harry Potter series. The writing is simply superb and offers devoted readers into the depths of Voldemort\\'s past, while offering us some budding romance amongst characters. I was constantly reading, and could not imagine putting the book down once I was at a good part. I thought that Harry\\'s teenagerish attitude was toned down in a pleasant way due to the fact that he was becoming so insightful into the mind of his greatest enemy and realizes that he must be the one to kill Voldemort. Harry POtter has always been an emotional read for me, but the waterworks were multiplied this time as I cried at Harry\\'s trimuphs and tribulations. But, by far the saddest moment of my life so far has been Dumbledore\\'s death and funeral. I cried myself to sleep, resulting in squinty eyes and a palid complexion the next morning, but I could have cared less, because one of my favorite fictional friends has just died. Needless to say, I have never gotten over the shock and horror of it. can\\'t see my screen through the tears this re-read has been MOST painful and utterly worth it This book is very much more about the origins of Voldemort than the others were. So far, my least favourite of the series (next to the Goblet of Fire). Harry is in top form here, though- not the whiny, angry brat of the previous book, and he gets quite a bit snarkier, which is nice. However, I don\\'t think I could really get into it because the first three quarters is rather boring- mostly it\\'s just teenage wizard drama, which is only slightly more interesting to me than normal teenage drama (that is to say, not very). The story really seems to lose its way here. The ending, though, was action-packed and lovely, which I hope is a sign of things to come for Deathly Hallows, and not just the beginning of a painful decline. Initial thoughts: My anger at what happened towards the end of this book is overshadowing how I feel about it as a whole. Review to come when the rage dies down. Review: Actual rating: 4 Never-Have-I-Ever-Felt-So-Much-Rage stars. No spoilers. I\\'m not even going to attempt to write a full review for this book. Why? There\\'s a bazillion other detailed reviews out there. Instead, I will share with those of you that are reading this my feelings on this book. I reached a poignant section towards the end, and found myself yelling at the book. I was on the other side of the country at the time I read this. I\\'d just gone to Harry Potter World at Universal Studios Orlando with my fellow book nerd friend Annette and our husbands. So I got the itch to read this one. I borrowed her hardback copy of it. If it hadn\\'t been for that, I would\\'ve taken my rage out on the book. I sent some very hateful and rage-filled messages to my friend Annette. Not directed at her, of course. I needed to vent. I hated Rowling for what she did. I said I wasn\\'t even going to finish this book after that part. I walked away from it. I wouldn\\'t have finished it or even completed the series if Annette hadn\\'t twisted my arm and convinced me to. I calmed down. I finished the book. I finished the series. And I haven\\'t written Rowling off my list of authors I will read. However, I don\\'t agree with what she did. Annette tells me it\\'s necessary for the story. But that doesn\\'t mean I have to like it. The rest of the book was sooooo good, I can\\'t avoid giving it less than 4 stars. My rage almost put this on the DNF shelf with 1 star though... Always wish we could see more of Harry and Ginny\\'s cuteness You know what is wholly amazing about rereading these books? You pick up on teeny tiny little things, that BRING elements of the whole story together. \"The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog\\'s Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was. Mundungus! THIS SCENE IS MUNDUGUS SELLING SIRIUS\\' MIRROR TO ABERFORTH HELLO CAN WE APPRECIATE HOW THIS IS TRULY WONDERFUL. Sorry this is a waste of a review, it was too long to post as a general update, and I felt like I had to say it. It keeps getting better. After Goblet of Fire, I was blown out of my comfort zone and started down a dark path. Order of the Phoenix added to it, by showing just how far the enemy infiltrated the world. Now, in the Half-Blood Prince, we finally can see the light at the end of the tunnel, the darkest days with a small glimmer of light, hope. This emotional roller coaster of a novel is the best thus far. Deserves a full 5 out of 5 stars and just screams, ready part 7 immediately after. To Ms. J.K. Rowling, Biggest plot twist ever and this book actually surprised me for Miss J.K. Rowling\\'s attempts to romance! I loved it to bits! 2nd read before movie #8 A good number six on a long series. I liked getting to see different sides of well known characters. How Draco fears for his and his families life but doens\\'t really want to hurt anyone. Harry and Ginny finally get together, we finally get to know more about Snapes history and start the real work finding horcruxes. I wasn\\'t fond of the scene with Dumbledoor and harry in the cave. It was meant to be scary, but I found it ludicrous. I did like the scene where Snape saves Draco\\'s ass and kills Dumbledoor. Snape is my favourite antihero ever! I am listening to this book for about the 6th time. I need a story which will carry me along without much effort and yet capture my interest and challenge me to see more than I saw the last time. There are confusing times in my life when this comfort read is exactly what I need and Rowling and Jim Dale, the narrator, always deliver. In this book, Harry finds a potions book from a former student and when he follows the instruction, he produces extraordinary results. Hermione is deeply troubled by the book and insists that he turn it in. Who is the Half-Blood Prince? It is hard to review this book without giving the plot away, so I will stick to the generalities. We learn a lot more about Tom Riddle and how he came to be Lord Voldemort. The reader begins to have a little sympathy for him...until he reveals his cold bloodedness at such a young age. It goes way beyond the mind of a schoolboy. We get to see a lot more of the pensive and it begins to reveal the prequel to the stage that is set for Harry when he comes to Hogwarts. I think the pensive is an absolutely brilliant device. I would love to have one myself! Suddenly, Harry is there, seeing the people in the past as they were without being interpreted by flawed memories. I think the memories also reveal the depth of Rowling\\'s talent. She has constructed these books as if she knew from the very beginning just where she was going every step of the way. Tiny bits of information in book 1, come back in book 6 and their importance is revealed. In fact, I think that is why I keep coming back to these books. I make connections that completely eluded me up to that point. I am in awe of the depth of her organization for what is ostensibly juvenile fiction. jeez, i forgot how long some of these books are. Dumbledore dies. There. I ruined it for you! muahahahahaha! Time for a re-read! Best of the series. Getting towards the end of my audiobook reread! I think I might have only read Books 6 & 7 once when they originally came out (as opposed to the multiple reads the others got before each release) so it\\'s been great revisiting them. Jim Dale is fantastic as always. Faster, richer, and more productive than the previous installments. Now finally we\\'re getting somewhere. This one didn\\'t drone on and on about teenager problems as much as the past two books. While yes, there are some dating troubles that come out of nowhere, usually it\\'s quite funny and temporary, instead of dramatic -- I can mock the characters more easily for their halfwitted fumblings, and move on quickly to the real plot. There are also many things recalled up from the past: places, names, and past events are actually acknowledged and used in the plot. Finally Rowling isn\\'t expanding her wizarding world as much as she is focused on using it to develop characters. But Ron is still annoying as ever in this one. Some things never change. But at least something bad happens to him, that I could laugh at. Malfoy and Snape are left in the background for most of the book, and you don\\'t know what\\'s going on for months at a time. It\\'s simply tiresome that their mysterious situations are continuously brought up in Harry\\'s questioning mind, with no resolution until the end. Although I suppose you have to put the climax somewhere. And a lot of the dialogue toward the end felt very contrived -- as if Rowling suddenly had to get out a lot of information and just stuck it in anyone\\'s mouth. ut at least Dumbledore\\'s death made up for it!  large amount of annoyance can be made up for by the tragic and meaningful death of a main character. o good book is complete without killing off at least one person who is important. But I liked this one the best so far -- now Voldemort actually becomes a realistic villain, with a past and a motive. He gets his own plot, so to speak, no longer just a scary mysterious force in the shadowy background. Finally Dumbledore actually talks to Harry about specifically what is going on with Voldemort. Finally some questions are answered. I just had to get through six books to reach it. But Harry is still as obnoxious as ever in this one. Having hindsight about what\\'s really going on with Snape and Dumbledore shows to me just how much of a dunce he is. And even Dumbledore seems foolish and ignorant -- both he and Harry should have trusted and communicated with each other much more throughout all these years. Just ask each other! Tell each other what\\'s happening! You could save a lot of tears, time, and effort. Also, now that I think about it, the whole situation with Ginny really bothers me. She\\'s not developed at all in any books leading up to this. In this book she\\'s forgotten again, until one day Harry realizes he likes her. Are you really that lazy, Rowling? Come on. Your main character sucks so much that you have to make his romantic interest sit stale and useless in the background, until your protagonist finally notices her for a bit, before dumping her again? I\\'m not even going to set this off as a spoiler, because it\\'s such a minor part of a much deeper story, and so insignificant for Harry and Ginny as characters. She sits there and takes Harry\\'s \"I\\'m so brave by myself\" moment, because it\\'s some subtextual, poignant relationship stuff? But there\\'s no foundation. Ginny is just another person Harry rejects as he goes off to try by himself, until he will ultimately screw up again and have to be bailed out. What a lame excuse for a romance. Why couldn\\'t it be deep and meaningful and have a foundation that\\'s actually been set up in the books before this? Or even in the beginning of this book! Alright, on to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows! Oh man. This one is much much better than I realised the first time I read it. Killer. Great Story. Can\\'t wait to read the next one. We learn a lot more about Lord Voldmort\\'s background. The overall storyline moves forward pretty well in regard to Harry, Dumbledore, Draco Malfoy and Snape. Another fabulous addition to the Harry Potter world. This book, like the rest, delves into the life of Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived. The characters in this series are so well developed that you will fall in love with many of them. The world building is very dynamic and many people that read the books are waiting for their letter inviting them to Hogwarts (even those of us over the age requirement of 11.) I reread this series every 2-3 years. I assume that at some point they will grow old but it has been 15 years and I still love them with a fiery passion. This book finally usurped PRISONER OF AZKABAN as my favorite. Intense with fantastic character and relationship development, great background on Voldemort, and powerful ideas about love and family. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. Holy crap. If I thought Order of the Phoenix had the most heartbreaking ending, well, this one just left me lying still and unable to speak for hours. I\\'m absolutely devastated and frightened of what\\'s going to happen next now that the person we all look up to is dead. The thing about Dumbledore is that he seem to hold everything in place. As though everything is right in the world when he\\'s around. And seeing him vulnerable and weak was just painful and distressing. I really enjoyed reading this one, it showed more of where Voldemort came from and it just has that evil vibe in it, making readers curl up in their seats like they belong to the wizarding world. What I noticed in this story is that it grows as Harry grows older. I love it. I really wish I hadn\\'t seen the movies before reading these :( But the experience is so much different and I still recommend reading them even if you\\'ve seen the movies a thousand times! Definitely one my favourites, if not my favourite, in the series. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince......... OMG HERE WE GO! ... What do I say? As always, it\\'s a knock out of the park. This whole series is just a masterpiece. Somehow, even into the sixth book, I don\\'t feel bored with the story yet. I\\'d think that by now, I\\'d be bored with it. They follow the same pattern. Harry at home, eager for an adventure, gets the call to adventure, train ride to Hogwarts, first few classes, typically a new DADA teacher, in this one a new potions teacher, problems with Draco, Quidditch stuff, Christmas break, Harry gets more suspicious and tries to figure out what\\'s going on, big plot twist as the bad guy isn\\'t who you expected, school year finished, head home. Somehow, though, the books are all enjoyable. I\\'ll add on top of that that I\\'ve seen the movies, and still pretty vividly remembered Half-Blood Prince and all the events that transpire. Sadly, this means of course that I knew the plot twists and turns. It was still enjoyable, though. For some reason, maybe because I\\'ve been reading the books consecutively since December/January, I\\'m not chomping at the bit to read Deathly Hallows. Maybe it\\'s also the dread of being the last (main) Harry Potter novel. I\\'m still really curious to see exactly how Snape is presented in the final book - I know most of the plot twists, but I still need to see how it\\'s explained in the books. For instance, I think the movie doesn\\'t explain at all the origin of the name Half-Blood Prince. So I\\'m hoping the book explains some of the lingering questions I have about Snape. I\\'m also very curious to see how the final book is presented compared to the movie. Since they had to make two movies out of one book, I\\'m curious if they moved scenes around to sort of give each movie a beginning, middle and an end. So! No question about this one. Five stars. I\\'m also beginning to regret my having given Chamber of Secrets the lone four star rating in the series (I think). Looking back at it now, although Chamber of Secrets seemed to be kind of ho-hum, it really does add many important things to the series. Ginny\\'s interest in Harry, more about the Ministry of Magic, hinting to Horcruxes, Tom Riddle\\'s diary, the name Tom Riddle, more about Harry speaking in the language of snakes, and so on. I don\\'t know, but that book just appeared to not really live up to its predecessor. But a LOT happens in a short amount of time. But anyway, Half-Blood Prince. Five stars of course. The whole series is truly a masterpiece, and deserves every bit of acclaim it\\'s been given. I really hate the age we live in, it\\'s so full of stupid and evil people, and we have so few great leaders nowadays. No Martin Luther King\\'s, no Thomas Jefferson\\'s, no George Washington\\'s. A lot of our literature I think is over-rated, authors appealing to teenage girls who go crazy for fads. But despite it all, I do feel a measure of pride to know I live in the same time as J.K. Rowling. To think if in times gone by, you lived in the days of Austen or Dickens or Twain or Poe. But I can say I lived in the days of Rowling. That makes me feel a bit better about life. At least there is one great person in the world who I know walked the earth the same time as me. At least there was one significant addition to literature that happened in my lifetime. Sadly, it took me a couple decades before I caught onto it, but at least I finally got around to giving the series a genuine chance, and I\\'m real glad I did. If somehow you haven\\'t read the Harry Potter books yet, whatever your reason, quit being an idiot. You are really missing out on a masterpiece. You\\'re walking right by the freaking Mona Lisa and aren\\'t even stopping to give it a glance. Argh! I cried all over again. #1 favorite of the series. Something I hadn\\'t noticed before: Rowling\\'s fondness for the phrase \"at once.\" I was very bored at first, but ended up really enjoying this book. This book is the definition of sexual tension. It was killing me! I was very frustrated with the characters for reasons that I can\\'t say and the ending completely shattered me. I was crying and I was in school so you can imagine the looks I got. I would have enjoyed this much more if I hadn\\'t known who would die and who the Half-Blood Prince was. I was spoiled majorly and that really hindered my entire enjoyment of it. But it was still a fabulous installment in this series and I am looking forward to reading the final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Plot- 9/10 Characters- 9.5/10 Writing- 9/10 World Building- 9.5/10 Total- 9.2/10 Quickie Review- Another fantastic book in the Harry Potter series. The whining of Harry and his friends were not as frequent, and while you could tell they were still teenagers, it wasn\\'t irritating. More complex relationships formed, and the plot took a darker turn. The addition of the horcruxed made the plot interesting, what with the exclusion of quidditch and the Triwizarding Tournament. The climax was beautifully done, and while it was chaotic, it was controlled and well-executed, so I knew what was going on. This was also a turning point for Draco and his role in this series. He really took a strong position as an antagonist. As well, the twist with Snape at the end was unexpected and awesome. It set the stage for the last book. ** spoiler alert ** So you would think after all of these emotions and comments and everythings about being engaged my fiance and I would be glued together at the lips because we are obviously very much more in love than the rest of the people in the world who are simply dating. Or maybe it was because of these overwhelming emotions that caused him to simply say, \"Want to just read together for a while? I know you\\'ve been wanting to finish the sixth for a while now.\" And that is yet another reason that caused me to realize, yes, I do not need to have minor panic attacks over whether or not this man is right for me because he accepts the fact that I am twenty-one years old and still reading Harry Potter. I remember the exact place I was sitting when I read Dumbledore\\'s death scene for the first time, and now I remember the second. The first time I was sitting on the edge of my bed, broke down in tears (partially because it was late into the night, and partially, of course, because Dumbledore just freaking died). The second time I was sitting in bed, next to you. You were reading that novel about the monks and the kidnapping, and I was reading about Malfoy having internal conflicts about good versus evil. The first time I read Dumbledore\\'s death scene, I was so overwhelmed that I skimmed the rest of the novel, because, quite frankly, it is just too much to go on. The second time I read Dumbledore\\'s death scene, I was so overwhelmed that I skimmed the rest of the novel, because, quite frankly, it was still just too much to go on. I put my head on his shoulder and sighed. He looked down at me. \"Dumbledore...he.... \" I whined. He smiled. \"Oh...\" he said, in that falsely sympathetic tone. Not growing up with the series, he will never fully understand, but I appreciate the fact that he tries. MAAAAAAAAAAAKE OUTS. I know a lot of awesome stuff happened in this book, but really, I can\\'t get past Harry\\'s snark and the fact that everyone is constantly trying to make out with each other in this book. God, I love J. K. Rowling. She\\'s hilarious. I thought this book was as hard to put down as the previous book in the series. I\\'m glad I was able to start it on a Friday night so that I could spend lots of time reading it over the weekend. This next week is probably going to be frustrating, though. I\\'ll be anxious to read the last book but I won\\'t have nearly as much reading time as I would like during the work week. I\\'m giving this book 5 stars for the same reason I gave the previous book 5 stars - because of how much it gripped me and took over my life, causing me to spend every spare moment possible reading it. But that doesn\\'t mean I like everything that happened in the book. I really can\\'t write anything else that wouldn\\'t risk spoiling the fun (and in some cases torture) for anybody who still hasn\\'t read this series, so the rest is in spoiler tags. k, I know I said in my last review that I wanted to see more of Dumbledore, and I was really happy that this book had so much of him in it. here were some really great moments between him and Harry. ut I hated that he died! f all of the characters Rowling could have killed off, he was the one that I least wanted to see die. t might be odd, but his death had more emotional impact on me than I think either Ron\\'s or Hermione\\'s would have if one of them got killed. n the other hand, Dumbledore\\'s death didn\\'t take me completely by surprise. \\'ve had this niggling worry since the very early books that he was doomed to die by the end.  can\\'t even really explain why. aybe it\\'s just that the character type - kindly, wise, elderly mentors - don\\'t often seem to fare very well in fictional stories.  just kept hoping that I was wrong.  had thought it would happen in the last book if it happened at all, though.  can kind of see the point of doing it in this book, for the sake of Harry\\'s character growth since he is the main character after all. his forces him to be the one making the big decisions now. arry won\\'t have Dumbledore\\'s wisdom to fall back on (even if he did ignore it way too often) or the safety and rescues he often provided. here were some things that didn\\'t add up, though.  was always waffling about where Snape\\'s loyalties were. t\\'s hard to consider somebody to be one of the \"good guys\" when he holds onto his anger so steadfastly and when he treats people with such prejudice. laming Harry for his father\\'s behavior was unfair and irrational and, if he was really working against Voldemort, it seemed like he often put his own petty interests ahead of the good of the cause. o I was never 100% sure - was he as evil as he acted? r was he a misguided and hateful person who was still genuinely working against Voldemort? r was most of his behavior a big act to make certain Voldemort would believe he was still working for him even when he wasn\\'t?  usually swung toward one of the last two explanations because Dumbledore trusted him and I couldn\\'t imagine Dumbledore being wrong.  know he wasn\\'t infallible, but I figured he had a really, really good reason for trusting Snape. arry believed that Dumbledore was bamboozled by Snape\\'s apparent regret about leading to the death of Harry\\'s parents when Snape hated them to begin with. hat doesn\\'t make sense to me because Dumbledore was definitely not a fool. e was wise enough to be cautious about Tom Riddle, so why would he be any less cautious with Snape who had undeniably been serving Voldemort? t just seems like there had to be more to Dumbledore\\'s belief that Snape could be trusted.  also thought it was weird that Dumbledore said \"Please\" to Snape right at the end, as if he was asking him not to kill him. hat\\'s how Harry interpreted it, anyway. f Dumbledore really had realized at that point that Snape wasn\\'t really on his side, I still don\\'t think he would have done anything remotely like beg for his life. t seemed wrong and completely out of character. o I can\\'t help but hope there\\'s some sort of trick going on - that this was some sort of an elaborate ruse and things aren\\'t really as they appear.  know that\\'s really unlikely, though. e know that Harry apparently became unfrozen from his paralysis the moment Dumbledore died, and his phoenix Fawkes began mourning shortly after his death also. he characters all saw his dead body. nd we saw Snape agree to the unbreakable promise that he would help Malfoy accomplish his objective which Malfoy made pretty clear was to kill Dumbledore. n the other hand, if Snape wasn\\'t really on Voldemort\\'s side, then he surely would have told Dumbledore about the plot and they would have had time to come up with something... but I\\'m probably overthinking it just because I didn\\'t want Dumbledore to die. k, moving on! here was quite a bit of teenage romance angst in this book. ore than I wanted, although at least the Harry/Cho thing seems to be well over with.  didn\\'t like Cho at all. inny is at least likeable. he Hermione/Ron thing got a little annoying, though.  don\\'t mind a relationship developing between the two of them, and it\\'s been obvious that was coming from early on, but the immature way they handled it got tiresome.  know, they\\'re teenagers and their behavior wasn\\'t abnormal, but I still didn\\'t really want to read about it. nd I wanted to throw my Kindle across the room every time I read \"Won-Won\". ech. n response to my review of book 3 on BookLikes, there was a bit of discussion about the Time-Turners. o I thought it was worth pointing out that they were referred to again in this book. arry, Ron, and Hermione are talking to Hagrid about why they didn\\'t sign up for his course this year and Hagrid suggests they could have \"applied for Time-Turners\" and Hermione tells Hagrid that they \"smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners\" when they were there. his seems to imply that there\\'s an application process by which people can request to use Time-Turners and that there are several of them. n book 3, it had seemed to me like Hermione was given a bizarrely unique experience by being allowed to use one, but this seems to indicate that it wasn\\'t unprecedented. here was also the tiniest hint of them in the previous book, but it wasn\\'t clear if Time-Turners were actually being referred to so I didn\\'t mention it in my last review.  loved the first chapter in this book where we get to see the muggle Prime Minister learn about magic and interact with the \"other minister\". hat was a very funny chapter and I enjoyed it even though I was anxious to get back to the main characters. umbledore\\'s interactions with Harry\\'s family a couple chapters later were hilarious too. One more book to go! I love this book. There\\'s not much else to say other than I love it and I really don\\'t want the series to end. 5/5 stars. At a loss for words, but, fortunately, I don\\'t need to even say anything. Everyone knows this is wonderful. On rereading, I think this is my favorite of the series. Hogwarts as Hogwarts, older kids=more interesting, less of Harry charging around angry, plus OMG ROMANCE. Not to mention that it\\'s really suspenseful and well-constructed. My only problem is the ridiculous Spider-Man style \"We cannot be together because it is too dangerous for you!\" bullshit. I don\\'t believe it for a second. OMG OMG OMG THE ENDING!! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT... Haha! Just kidding. While this book has been on the shelves for around 11 1/2 years (releases in July of 05), I know new kids are coming up and reading them. Adults that didn\\'t when they were younger are reading them so I couldn\\'t put a spoiler right at the beginning but like my other Harry reviews spoilers may pop up so I wouldn\\'t continue to read if I were you. Anyway...and yes this is more summery than review. Curse me. I just finished and I need to TYPE. The penultimate chapter of the Harry Potter saga, the Half Blood Prince seeings Harry even more upset than he was at the start of Order of the Phoenix, having lost his godfather at the end of that adventure. He is depressed, sad, and missing Sirius desperately. He also feels completely out of touch as to what is going on as no one is saying anything for fear of it getting caught in the wrong hands. Understandably. You really do not know who is on what side, not really, even if you think you know do you really? Luckily Harry is soon sent to the Burrow after helping convince Horace Slughorn to join the staff of Hogwarts. Harry thinks he is going to be their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher since that position has a new face every year. At the Burrow he learns that Bill and Fleur (from Goblet of Fire) are engage and to be wed the following year. Such happy news in otherwise dark times. Harry suspects Malfoy is up to no good because, well, he is Malfoy. The young wizard runs off to Knockturn Alley and into the dark magic shop Harry had found himself in back in year two. Malfoy as usual is acting suspicious, setting off half of Harry\\'s motivations for much of the book. At school, they learn Slughorn is now the potions teacher and Snape has finally earned the role he so desperately wanted, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. This is all much to our heroic trios dismay. Whatever Dumbledore and the other members of the Order may feel, they don\\'t trust him, Harry least of all. Since Slughorn is now potions master, Harry and Ron are able to join his NEWT class, having earn the proper grade. Which begs the question...if a student failed most of their OWLs...what do they do when they go back to hogwarts? Just go to the 1 or 2 they passed? Repeat? Maybe they just don\\'t come back? Then again Crabbe and Goyle are back so I guess they do just repeat. Anyway, in the NEWT level potions class, Harry manages to get his hands on a copy of the text that was owned by someone called \"The Half Blood Prince\" (ROLL CREDITS!). Having learned nothing from his previous adventures, Harry keeps the book and uses it to his advantage, gaining high praise and favor from Slughorn. Oh and earning himself a vial of liquid luck (to touch on the movie for a minute, the liquid luck scene is easily one of my favorites in the series). Harry also has secret, private lessons with Dumbledore. Knowing he will tell anyway, Dumbledore says Harry is free to say what happens in their meetings to Ron and Hermione (Dumbledore ain\\'t dumb). Through the pensieve (AKA memory pool of silver goo), Harry is taken through key points in Voldemort\\'s life, seeing his parents, his life at the orphanage, his time at school, and after he left Hogwarts. Each memory provides more and more insight into the Dark Wizard Harry feels he has to fight because of the prophecy. Even after Dumbledore explains the prophecy is irrelevant. Voldemort made it come true and that even if Harry hadn\\'t heard what it was about, he still would\\'ve wanted to end Voldemort\\'s life due to all the pain he has caused young Harry. Again, Dumbledore ain\\'t dumb. In one of the memories, we learn about Horcruxes. Well we almost do. The memory was tampered with and Dumbledore puts it on Harry to get the real memory from Slughorn, the reluctant witness. Harry is otherwise distracted by not just school and Quidditch but by following Malfoy. Katie Bell (a teammate of his) and Ron are both cursed by dark magic. While both survive, Harry is sure Malfoy is behind it and that his intent was to kill. Since Slughorn won\\'t provide the memory willingly, Harry focuses his attention on Malfoy, sure he is using the room of requirement to do whatever is he is doing. Pressured heavily by Dumbledore, Harry finally does manage to get the memory from Slughorn by using the vial of \\'liquid luck\\'. (AGAIN, love this scene in the movie) Essentially, he got Slughorn drunk at Aragog\\'s (the big spider from Chamber of Secrets) funeral and convinced him that he needed to give up the memory. The memory does provide a bit more insight into horcruxes. You kill someone and put a bit of your soul into an object or thing. Say...a diary or your father\\'s ring. What this means is, you can\\'t be completely killed, not while part of your soul is trapped in an object. Voldemort wanted to live forever and he found a way. An evil and dark way. Also kind of sad. Imagine having part of your soul trapped in a spoon for all eternity. These lessons also show Harry why the DADA\\'s position is cursed. Voldemort wanted it. Dumbledore, not be dumb, said no. Could you imagine Voldemort teaching? He would have a ready made army of hundreds all too soon. Since saying no, Dumbledore had been unable to find anyone to hold the position for more than year. This almost brought out a bit of a continuity error from book one as the way Hagrid introduces Quirrell, it seems as though he has held that role for a while but while Quirrell had been at the school for a few years, Harry\\'s first year at Hogwarts was his first year teaching DADA (it isn\\'t directly said in the books but was later cleared up by Rowling and as she is the Goddess of all things Harry Potter, her word is gold). Dumbledore finds the location of one of the horcruxes and he takes Harry on a journey to get it. It one of the more difficult parts of the book (at least for me), Harry forces a potion down Dumbledore\\'s throat at his request in order for them to claim the horcrux. They nearly get killed by some zombie like creatures but manage to escape back to the village just outside the school where they see a dark mark in the sky so they fly back to the school. And here the shit hits the fan. Draco, under orders of Voldemort, is supposed to kill Dumbledore but he can\\'t (Harry even ends up feeling bad for him after this if that says anything) so what happens? Snape does it. Snape. Kills. Dumbledore. The world shattered when they read that, when word got out to those who hadn\\'t finished the book yet. I still remember it clearly. Everyone was cursing Snape\\'s name (and the name of the guy who drove by people in line just after midnight and shouted \"SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE\" out his car window). At least a first. A few theories cropped up later about what side Snape was actually one, leading to some to not quite want to see Harry kill him in the next book (except that guy in the car. Fuck that guy. Harry can kill him.) But that first night and day, everyone hated Snape just like Harry did. He wasn\\'t on the good side after all. He was always on the side of Voldemort. Other things that happened: Tonks wants to be with Lupin (he eventually gives in), Ron made out with Lavender Brown to piss off Hermione. Hermione pretended to like some guy who\\'s name i can\\'t be bothered to look up right now. And oh...Harry kissed Ginny. Right in the common room. After Gryffindor had won the Quidditch cup again. In front of Ron. Harry isn\\'t going back to Hogwarts. He wants to find the last 4 horcruxes to defeat Voldemort. He wants to kill Snape too for obvious reasons. Overall, a great read. So much happens that needed to happen to bring us to the final showdown in the next book (which I\\'m sad to say I only read once. I know I\\'m horrible). Harry learns a lot more about Voldemort. Probably more than he wanted to know but what he needed to know. Sometimes knowing the motivations behind someone\\'s behavior is helpful in knowing how to defeat him. Voldemort wanted to be the most powerful, he wanted to hurt people from a young age. Of course he would hide his soul into objects that did not belong to him. Of course he would be arrogant enough to believe that putting his soul into 6 other places would give him power beyond measure. But he is still human..sort of. Well he was at some point. Now he\\'s a giant dickhead with a lot of power like our president. But he can be defeated. Harry knows how. He just has to learn to trust in his friends and in himself. This is my favorite book in the Harry Potter franchise. New mysteries were added, the suspense really kicked up a notch, and we saw new insights into familiar characters. The writing flowed smoothly, and the story progressed at a very reasonable pace. Harry Potter and the Dumbledore is Never Straightforward About Anything, Ever. Also Harry Potter and the It\\'s Not Who You Think It Is, Harry, Part 2. My least favorite so far but still great. In the end accounting, I think this is my favorite of the books. Less whiny than the book before, and tighter. But long enough for details that I savored. I actually like this more than the fifth now. Ooof. Heavy end. Good set-up for the end, though. I\\'m just a lot not okay... This book was fantastic. A lot of relational developments and naturally development to the over arching plot. This book was so fast paced and so eventful I can\\'t really believe I\\'m done with it already. It doesn\\'t quite compare to The Order of the Phoenix but it tops all the others before it. I can\\'t believe I\\'ve come this far in the series and how emotionally involved I am in these books. The ending left the most bitter taste in my mouth for I too felt betrayed and horrified by the events that occurred. Ugh I am too emotionally damaged and drained to say anymore. THIS BOOK. THE FEELS. THESE TEARS. MY HEART. The plot turned even more intriguing. In this book, Hogwarts is not as safe as it used to be. The deeply-felt emotions of the characters propel action. Harry couldn\\'t help but notice that some of them are mysteriously up to something. Dumbledore, and Malfoy especially. I LOVED READING EVERY BIT OF THIS BOOK!!! The twists and turns of the plot, no matter how heart-wrenching a lot of them have been, gets me every time. The part in the beginning where Arthur and Molly Weasley exchanged questions as a precaution to make sure they were not Death Eaters was beyond adorable. This is also the book where I realized that Draco Malfoy is not a boy who made bad choices -- He just never had a choice. Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. WHOOP THERE IT IS. DRARRY is real. Even after their Sectumsempra encounter, I still ship Draco and Harry. The tension between them is palpable. \"It\\'s okay, we can fix it,\" said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand. \"I love you, Hermione,\" said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily. Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, \"Don\\'t let Lavender hear you saying that.\" WAAAAAAAHHH FANGIRL MOMENT. This is the first time Ron finally said \"I love you.\" to Hermione. I ship them so hard. ROMIONE. Half-Blood Prince = Severus Snape Professor Snape finally got to teach Defense Against the Darks Arts in this book. He is absolutely one of my favorite characters. Like Draco Malfoy, he\\'s also in a fix. He didn\\'t have a choice but to follow what Narcissa Malfoy and Professor Dumbledore asked of him. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. -- Albus Dumbledore Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is a character revered by a great number of people. He is certainly one of my personal favorites. I was so heartbroken when I first watched how he died in the movie. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I still couldn\\'t help but be sad all over again after reading it. Reading this book made me feel all kinds of feels. Both the book and the movie has a dreary vibe (in terms of color, background, and atmosphere.) Another excellent read. My heart, my feelings... excellent because we finally get a good look into voldemort\\'s backstory here. although rowling starts to introduce so many new ideas and elements, it\\'s pretty mind-boggling to think that she has to wrap all this up in book 7. i may have been the only person in the world who was not THAT upset by the death at the end. i was more affected (oh let\\'s face it, i still am!) by the death in book 5. Rereading HP books at the age of 22. Still equally awesome. OH MY I have 19 day to finish the Harry Potter series CHALLENGE ACCPETED This one keeps you wondering about who is the half blood prince. I cried and cried at the end of this one even though I knew the ending was inevitable. By the end of the book, it seems like it should\\'ve been joined with the next one. It\\'s probably the most depressing end of any of the books in the series. I\\'ve got tears in my ears from reading the end of this while lying on my back in bed. This one moved soooo much faster than 5. Loved it. Most recent re-read in November 2015. I love this book so much and all of the horrible feels it gives me. This book is amazing. Absolutely brilliant. The plot is so intricate and thought out to perfection, every little detail worked out. The ending is so sad, and full of darkness and death ahead, but lit with rays of hope. I love this book, I love the whole series. Competely amazing. There was no waking from this nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors had died, and he was more alone than he had ever been. No one warned me this series would break my heart over and over again. DRAMATIC END ! The story continues of course. There were some great moments in this one ! Ron and Hermione getting together ! Harry And Ginny ! That escalated way too fast ! Strange to say but the Romance part of the book was only the entertaining part for me ! Until the end drama of course. The entire time the story was so dull. Stuck only to \" What\\'s MALFOY DOING ? It missed that \\'adventure\\' part of fantasy world. There were hardly any new characters or new places. So yeah. I had to push myself through 75% of the book. The ending was good! That saved the book ! SPOILER Woah! Snape killing dumbledore ! Couldn\\'t have thought abt it ! That was certainly unexpected. Why did Dumbledore trust Snape so much? I hope they answer that in the next book. The last book I think will be the best one ! Also I still don\\'t approve of Fleur and Bill\\'s Wedding :p ** spoiler alert ** Brilliant story. Knowing what I know now, having read the series all the way through a few times, this reread provided much more depth. For example, I had never caught the fact that Voldemort truly did curse the Defense Against the Dark Arts position (pg. I mean, I had assumed, but I had never truly known.  understood Snape\\'s actions this time through as well and it made the book all the more interesting as I tried to work everything out. \\'ve also decided that Hagrid acts as a bridge between the understood and the feared; he is a friend to all creatures, deadly or not, and it is he who carries Dumbledore to his tomb and he also carries Harry back to the castle when Voldemort believes him to be dead .  loved watching the friendship between Ron and Hermione blossom into a romance, not to mention the relationship between Harry and Ginny which doesn\\'t really get anywhere until the end of the book. All in all, this is a very good book and it is a part of a brilliant series I believe I will enjoy in every stage of my life. Update: 8 times I\\'ve read this book. I enjoyed it far better in this reading because I didn\\'t let myself spend the book furious at Dumbledore. I\\'ve done that in the past and all it did was make the book a chore to get through. I\\'m still bugged at Dumbledore and his secrets, and bothered that no one ever listens to Harry despite the fact that her guesses proved to be right nearly every time throughout the series, but in a far more reserved corner of my mind. Severus Snape\\'s betrayal was more fun to read with this attitude as well. Who cares if everyone\\'s wrong about him? For the sake of this book, he\\'s a traitor, and after all the abuse he has thrown at the students throughout the rest of the series, I\\'m quite content to send him some hate in return. (Yes I know he\\'s fictional, but why on earth should that mean that my feelings about him and the impact the books have had on me aren\\'t entirely real?) I grew up reading HP and I have always loved it, every bit of it! Half-blood prince for me was the best novel. I really think it showed a bigger part of the pre-story we never knew before. Also it showed what made Snape exactly the way he was. I\\'m not going to spoil it for anyone who ( has lived under under a rock and) haven\\'t read it,but I strongly reccomend it. This is my favorite book in the entire series. Harry, Ron and Hermione are no longer little kids but they are still at Hogwarts. I love that they are finally moving into having relationships and falling in love (which is usually my favorite part of books). In this book Dumbledore is finally has a big role and appears several times to help Harry better understand Voldemort and the task at hand. Finally, in this book it is spelled plain out that Hermione and Ron have a thing for each other, this was my favorite part when I first read this book. I remember when I first read the part with Ron taking the love potion and I didn\\'t realize what was happening only that he was telling Harry he was in love with someone I was absolutely ecstatic in thinking he meant Hermione. I was wrong of course but I still love that chapter. Then on top of Ron and Hermione we get a love interest for Harry too. I However didn\\'t like this relationship as much but eh it\\'s slightly better than Cho and Harry. Now that I am re-reading the series I have found that I just don\\'t feel any chemistry between Harry and his love interest. I think that is why I just don\\'t feel as interested or invested in his love interest. First he likes Cho but up until the moment that he states how pretty she is while playing quidditch against her she isn\\'t even mentioned, then every time after that when they encounter each other Harry\\'s thoughts tells us how much he likes her and this is fine and dandy but I just don\\'t feel a connection with his fancying her. Pretty much he just decides oh I like Cho because she is pretty and I don\\'t really know her but I\\'m going to pine over her for the next year or so until I actually go on one date with her and realize she\\'s a complete pain and at that point I will pretty much just forget about her all together. For me it just doesn\\'t work I need interaction and little hints of chemistry. Now as I am reading this book I again feel a lack of a back relationship between Ginny and Harry before he is over his head in love with her. Sure in book 2 we are introduced fully to Ginny Weasley\\'s character, outside the little platform introduction that I don\\'t count from book 1, she is Ron\\'s little sister that has a sort of celebrity crush on Harry. Harry saves her life and all that good stuff but they are like twelve so it\\'s not some epic romance in development just Harry living up to the Hero role. After that Ginny pops in and out of the books casually always seen pretty much for being Ron\\'s little sister and we don\\'t really get to see her development into her teen years the way we do with Harry. For me until the fifth book (and even for a good part of the fifth book) in my mind she is still that little eleven year old trapped in the chamber of secrets. The fifth book Ginny is a more frequent character starting in the beginning chapters and until the big battle at the ministry but still I don\\'t feel any kind of inkling that either Harry or her like each other, she has a few boyfriends in this year and I guess that is a hint that she isn\\'t the little girl anymore but really Harry doesn\\'t notice or have any pang of jealousy. (Still talking book 5) Yes, I know this is because he is in la-la I love Cho forever imaginary land but still I want a little development and chemistry; let\\'s face it Ron is jumping down Hermione\\'s throat every time he mention\\'s Krum why can\\'t Harry show some of these emotions. Even after Harry has completely wrote off Cho and we move into the sixth book where he is going to get with Ginny there\\'s not really any hints until almost halfway through the book. I feel like it would have felt more satisfying for me if there had been bigger hints towards this relationship before it just was happening, then I could have been at least cheering for Harry and Ginny. When I read this book the first time I was right there with cheering Harry on to be against Snape and Draco, this time I just see how foolish Harry acts becoming so obsessed with them. He is repeatedly told by everyone to just let it go and in the end being himself he doesn\\'t listen. I think his hate for these characters is always causes Harry to have twice as many obstacle\\'s then he would have. As I read this time I paid close attention to Snape and how everything between him and Dumbledore could have two meanings. If Harry would have just trust Dumbledore instead of insisting he could make mistakes he would have save himself a ton of time and energy. Ever since I finished the entire series years ago Snape has been one of my Favorite Characters. I seriously cry every single time I read or watch Snape\\'s last memories. This time as I re-read this book I kind of thought of something I never put too much thought into before and that was that everyone saying if Dumbledore had so much trust in Snape why didn\\'t he give him the DADA job. Now I guess it\\'s pretty clear to me that Dumbledore knew that the position was cursed and didn\\'t give him the job because he need him to stick around, but then gives it to him in the sixth year because he knows that it is time for Snape to leave and join Voldemort. In a way I guess that when Snape was given the job at the beginning of the book it should have been obvious that Snape would be leaving Hogwarts by the end of the book and not returning as the Dark Arts teacher. This book gets me ever time also, late last night while I finished off that last few chapters of this book I was crying like a baby the whole time. When a book can make me feel that much, that is what makes it a favorite book for me. I enjoy books that make me cry. One last thing I want to mention before a top five list is the artwork in these books. When I started re-reading the series the pictures were kind of silly looking if I am being honest. But around book 4 the art gets so much better and this books art is probably my favorite so far. I thought the change and development of the art through the books was very interesting. Top 5 Favorite Parts Harry and Ginny kiss Arogog\\'s Funeral Tonk\\'s and Remus The entire last three chapters Ron taking the love potion I cried so very much with his book... I think in this book you can start forseeing the end of the saga, but not that much that make it predictible. I like what J.K. Rowling did with this book and with the whole saga i will never get over the ending of this book and i will cry, as i just did, every time i think of this book. no words can describe this book or how i feel about it. oh my god. Ugh the feels. I was hit with them all over again. I am probably going to fly through the seventh next...so much for re-reading them slowly. ** spoiler alert ** Ok so I am so behind like the whole world right now. And now I can imagine the shock that everybody received years ago. I am going to hide my review because of spoilers. But here is what I think.... I love Snape. I love his character, he is so misunderstood and I just could not get through this series without him. I don\\'t care if I end up being dead wrong, but it was all planned. Dumbledore asked Snape to kill him. I JUST KNOW IT... And Snape is not a traitor he can\\'t be. Dumbledore was no idiot. He trusted Snape. I don\\'t know why Dumbledore thought this was how it had to be. And there is a small part of me that thinks Dumbledore might just rise from the dead. I still can\\'t believe it. Dumbledore is the greatest character. I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do if Dumbledore really is dead. Ginny as Harry\\'s girl. First of the all the movie really played this up but I just don\\'t get this relationship. They hardly ever spend any time together and now all of sudden Harry is into her. I mean I never shipped Hermione and Harry, no way. But Ginny really??? Can\\'t we do better than her... Plus don\\'t you think it is really creepy that she looks just like his mom... I mean just like her. Anyways, I\\'m freaking out right now because my best friend who got me into this crazy series in the first place is not answering her phone... and I need to talk about all my feels in regards to this book....... My head is spinning right now. I have to get my hands on the next book. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince by J.K. Rowling is the 6th in the series. Harry Potter continues to enthrall. The books, although for all ages, are getting darker. We have lost Cedric. We have lost Sirius. Now we lose another. It starts with visits...the Ministry of Magic visiting the Prime Minister in the Muggle World.....Narcissa Malfoy visiting Severus Snape....and Dumbledore visting Harry at the Dursleys. A new Potions teacher, Horace Slughorn will join the school, and Snape will be teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts (much to Harry\\'s disappointment). Slughorn has a secret that Dumbledore desperately needs, and he instructs Harry to discover it. Dumbledore and Harry will work closely together to try and put an end to Voldemort. Harry discovers he is excellent at Potions, as long as he uses the instructions in the book he found by someone called the Half-Blood Prince. This book may not be a good idea. Harry is suspicious when he saw Malfoy in a store called Borgin & Berkes. He thinks Malfoy is a death eater, like his father. When strange things happen at school, they seem to confirm his suspicions. On a lighter note, sort of, romance is in the air, and it is putting a strain on the relationship between Harry, Ron and Hermione. When Ron discovers Hermione kissed Viktor Krum, he is not impressed. Suddenly he is dating Lavender Brown. Now Hermione is not impressed. Harry is finding himself very interested in Ginny, but doesn\\'t know how to tell Ron. The ending is not happy. We lose someone else. Someone we have loved since Book 1. We know there is a reason for everything, but it is so hard. Deep breath. Okay, Rowling did another superb job of leading us from one dark event to the next, with so much suspense thrown in and an ending that takes us by surprise. How could you not want to continue? This is the first of the books that I bought on the release date- lets just say I came a little late to the party. However I am ashamed to say that it took me almost a full year after the release date to get around to reading it. At the time of the release I was working for a book store and after the thousands of calls I made to let our customers know that their copy would be available, all the events that were planned for the day, and the weekend itself I was a little Harry Pottered out for awhile. When I did finally get around to reading it I was pleasantly surprised to find a much more likable, less whiny Harry. My favorite Harry Potter book! This one is absolutely amazing, and is an all-time favorite of mine. This book has it all. I\\'ve read it three times, most recently because of the premiere of the movie. Read in 2007 Getting close to the end of the series and i\\'m excited and at the same time a little bit sad. I can\\'t think of the Harry Potter\\'s books as different part, to me they feel like the same huge book and everytime i read a new chapter. i really liked how i watched all the characters grow up and face uncountable dangers, all of this created a sort of bond. With every new part i feel like meeting old friends. This part was a little bit different, more interesting and touching. I liked it how the life of Lord Voldermort was retraced, he was no longuer just a shadow. i greatly enjoyed this book and i can\\'t wait to read the next and last one. Definitely the best Potter book I have read in my binge catch-up on one of the biggest cultural phenomena of the last decade or so. I did skim read some of the earlier books when they branched off into all the coming-of-age teenage stuff, which don\\'t really appeal to a man in his forties. This one I didn\\'t skim at all, as it stuck largely to moving the story on and setting up the conclusion. I liked all of the previous books a little better than this one. In this the story dragged on a little and I just wanted to get to the end. First Read - release night Second and third - ? Fourth - 2013 The Ones that Love Us, Never Really Leave Us Dumbledore, you will be missed <3 This was a re-read for me. Things I liked/noticed about this particular installment: + I really like Professor Slughorn. He\\'s just so good-natured in this one, and I love how he throws all these parties and everything. It\\'s oddly hilarious to me. + LUNA. Luna Lovegood is my favorite character. She\\'s actually probably in my Top 3 favorite characters of all time. I know that if I went to Hogwarts we would get along so well. + The disappearing cabinet with Malfoy doesn\\'t play as big of a part as it does in the movie? Which is a weird thing to say, since Harry is obsessing over Malfoy the whole book, but we don\\'t really  know  he\\'s up to something until the very end. + Quidditch. I love it in this one. How Ron proves himself to be a good Keeper without any help, when he thinks he took the lucky potion. + It\\'s always killed me a bit inside that the diadem was RIGHT. THERE. This has always been one of my favorite installments in the Harry Potter series. It doesn\\'t have very many boring parts in it. I will probably re-read this again in the future as well. This has got to be one of the best books in the series! It amazes me how J.K. Rowling manages to always come up with new plots and new twists when it comes to the story of Harry Potter. It never gets boring or cyclical. You can always expect one surprise after the next. In HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOODED PRINCE, Rowling breaks down a lot of background information for the books before. She takes us into the past and delves into the history and lives of many characters. We begin to realize that things are not always as they seem. There is not much to say in this review, without giving away too much of the book, but I will say that it is the most emotional of all six installments. You definitely get a sense that finality is not far away. There is of course death in the final chapter ... which is extremely tough to accept once you find out who, but what is harder to believe is the way it went down. This occurrence also will have HP fans wondering how in the world will Rowling continue the next phase of the Harry Potter series... ** spoiler alert ** First thing that came in my mind... \"bakit? bakit? si Dumbledore pa?!\" (Why? Why? Does it have to be Dumbledore?). But then I guess as the book and Harry\\'s story continues, life is not always rosy and good. Yet again, this is a very great book, as much anticipation had been build up for the last series. What did I do to deserve this. I\\'m blinded by my tears now so no review When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love. Here J.K. Rowling was getting me used to longer books, but for this one she trimmed off a few hundred pages. Honestly the story didn\\'t contain as much in some ways as the previous two that were longer, so the page length fit it. It\\'s that semi-awkward stage book where it\\'s going to lead to the last big-bang fight and wrap-up, has to introduce new stuff for the story but play on the old without wrapping that up just yet. Harry has lost his mope from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, feeling accepted again amongst his peers and not left out in the dark any longer, but he retains the natural anger and fear that he should have in his circumstance. There\\'s some mini developments between him and a female character romantically wise, which to me fits the series well. Hermione and Ron also are leaning toward each other more, even if they haven\\'t made it officially official just yet. If you\\'re a fan of Dumbledore, this book will both please and infuriate you. He\\'s in more scenes than ever while he gives Harry private lessons, showing both his and other people\\'s memories, all leading to a fascinating backstory focusing on Voldemort. You don\\'t actually get to see the monstrous villain in this book - you only hear about him, which is typical of the earlier installments. There\\'s a few death eaters popping up though, including Fenrir, a new big-bad I hadn\\'t noticed before, a demented werewolf of all things. Can I just say this guy is actually creepy? Especially his focus on hurting and turning children. As always these books are impossible to put down, since Rowling\\'s writing technique not only rocks, but she gives us unique characters who are individuals standing out from each other while working toward standing together unified. Rowling always introduces a new stand-out character in books; here it\\'s a new potions master who enjoys fame and getting to know students who he has determined are \\'going places.\\' Dumbledore has something else up his sleeve about this teacher, too... Pacing wise it\\'s okay, as this book is more of a filler than anything, but it does give us one big revelation concerning Voldemort. All the other books pointed toward this, but it\\'s now more obvious coming together when Harry sees the larger picture. While a stepping stone to the next book, \\'The Half-Blood Prince\\' is in no way boring. You get to see Harry with his friends and relationships, a little in the classes and especially wondering who on earth the Half-Blood prince is. That mystery intrigued me since I couldn\\'t figure it out for awhile, and I\\'d forgotten since watching the movie years back. While the new potions teacher is introduced, Snape finally gets his turn at \\'Defense against the Dark Arts.\\' I was slightly bummed we didn\\'t get to see more time spent in his class, however. I\\'ve always enjoyed the classroom teaching and experiences in the other books, and here was a chance to see freaking SNAPE of all people talking about the dark arts! Unfortunately there\\'s just the one classroom moment. Although we don\\'t see too much on the teaching side, Snape is still brilliantly constructed and a page-stealer when he comes on scene. As with the previous book, there\\'s a heartbreaking ending to this one, so have the tissues handy. I\\'ll keep them handy when I go on to the next and last book, where I know more depressing stuff will happen. And of course I\\'ll need tissues just knowing it\\'s the last book and that it\\'s time to get off this ride. These books keep getting better as they go. Great twists and turns, and a very fun story. IGGPPC March 2015 I\\'ve got the feels!!!! This book had me in tears! It had such a sad ending. This has to be my favorite Harry Potter book so far. I loved all of the flashbacks in the pensive. It gave more insight about Tom Riddle and his evilness. I\\'m so happy that Harry and Ginny got together. I\\'ve heard most people say Harry and Hermione should have ended up together, but I disagree. I think Ron and Hermione are perfect for each other. She keeps him in check. Drake Malfoy has gotten more evil and become a death eater, but that didn\\'t surprise me. I love Rowlings way of writing. She is extremely creative. oh gosh, I need the Deathly Hallows NOW This is where I pretend the next book doesn\\'t happen so I can continue feeling vindicated in my dislike of Snape. This book also makes me happy because Dumbledore gives Harry much more information and better prepares him for what lies ahead instead of being quite so cryptic. I also like Slughorn and he makes me feel a bit better about Pottermore sorting me incorrectly into Slytherin. There is a practicality about him that I like - when he gathers venom from Aragog, for example. This isn\\'t one of my favorites to reread but I do enjoy remembering how shocked I was by many things in this, such as the introduction to he Horcruxes and being obsessed with trying to figure out who RAB was. Reread 2016 Tears. Lots and lots of tears. This book was actually kind of terrifying! And what a finish... Made me laugh, made me cry... maybe my favorite in the Harry Potter series. I would give this book 6 stars if I could. This is still my favorite HP book and Ginny is still my favorite character. 11/1/10 - Starting up the series for, what, the eleventh time? Part of my personal HP challenge in which I must read books 1 - 6 before the release of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1\" on November 19th. Started #1 on 11/1/10, finished on 11/4/10. Started #2 on 11/4/10, finished on 11/6/10. Started #3 on 11/6/10, finished on 11/8/10. Started #4 on 11/8/10, finished on 11/14/10. Started #5 on 11/14/10, finished on 11/17/10. Started #6 on 11/17/10, finished on 11/19/10. I just barely scrapped by! I finished the sixth book on my lunch break on the 19th. It was touch and go for a while (I struggled with finding enough time to get through the fourth book), but I got it done in the end. ;D Now that I\\'ve seen the movie in theaters (twice! ), I\\'m planning on taking a leisurely stroll through the seventh book. This series will forever be the nearest and dearest to my heart. Loved it! Dumbledore takes Harry under his wing and shares with him glimpses of Lord Voldemort\\'s past. Harry learns what he needs to do before this last show down with Lord Voldemort arrives. First read: 2006? Second read: May 2012 Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect I cannot review HP but this I can do. Image in big size. Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect READING THIS BOOK WAS LIKE THROWING A THOUSAND NEEDLES TO MY HEART I wish I was writing this review before having already read book number 7. Just to be able to remember the feelings the book made me have for Snape, but I\\'m not saying anything more just in case you\\'re among the few lucky that still have a Harry Potter left to read for the first time. However, my general mood about this book has not changed through the years... I feel book number 6 is a very long introduction to the epilogue of the saga in book number 7. It doesn\\'t have the tension of neither book 5, 7 or 4. The best parts are the beginning and the end, i.e. the parts that don\\'t take place at Hogwarts, or that are not related to school in the more general sense of the term. That being said, this is still a Harry Potter, and even if it is not one of my favorites, it\\'s still a world class book. Glad you won\\'t experience the pang of disappointment at the end of it because you feel you needed more, as, lucky you, book 7 is already out there and you\\'ll not have to wait a whole year or two as I had to back then. I\\'m so glad to be reading these books finally. But I\\'m terrified of ending the series though. Then it\\'ll really be over for me. It\\'s been over for everyone else for so long. But I feel like it\\'s only just started for me, and I haven\\'t had enough time to savor the story. I don\\'t reread things as much now as I used to. But I\\'m loving this series now that everything is happening. Really, I\\'m just so glad there\\'s kissing now. Why did it take so long for there to be kissing? Okay, because they were babies. That\\'s a good reason. But geez, I like a little romance with my almost dying all the time. Anyway, I\\'m in love. I\\'ve been heartbroken. I know certain things are going to happen because I watched th movies one time years ago. But I never remember when they happen or how. So I\\'m been constantly surprised and gutted by the big reveals and betrayals and whatnot. It\\'s been a great rollercoaster. I\\'m already starting HP7, so I don\\'t really have time to give this more of a review. I\\'ve got to get listening. I knew what was going to happen i still cried i just dont understand why anyone has to die So Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is my least favorite HP movie, so I was pleasantly surprised that the book is a lot better. Even though, I kinda missed the whole deatheaters scene at the Burrow during Christmas, it was still way better. I throughly enjoyed this! Obviously a re-read, this time in english. Looooooooved it even more, if that is possible. Goodness gracious. JK Rowling, what are you trying to do to us? I don\\'t want to write a long review or spoil anything, but it was a good book. Dumbledore and Harry got closer, and Dumbledore became another father figure of Harry\\'s. hy do all the father figures die?! \\'m going to miss Dumbledore so much, he was one of my favorite characters. JK Rowling added more romance than there were in the previous novels. All the ships start to come up and I love all of them. Unlike other books, where romance and action are basically the plot, the romance was prominent and noticeable without drawing away from the action. It was really good and I liked it. Can\\'t wait to finish the series! So far, #3 and #6 are my favorites of the series. I\\'m glad that Harry got a little less whiny in this one than he was in #5. Another solid Potter novel. The Tom Riddle material is dark and excellent, though I wish there had been even more of it. I almost gave this book four stars again, but I can\\'t quite bring myself to do it. This is my least favorite book of series, but it still gripped me cover to cover. The main reason for my relative dislike is that not much happens in the book until the last third/half, though the ending is incredible. I do not like Ginny in the movies: she comes off as flat and uninteresting. In the books (especially this one), however, she is witty and works well with Harry. She is just as much a prankster as Fred and George, and though their reputation overshadows her, she is confident in who she is and just does whatever she wants. In the movies, Slughorn is perfectly depicted. Narcissa Malfoy should have been more ruthless. I wish Voldemort\\'s eyes had been red. Previous rating:  in late 2009/early 2010 My least favorite book in the series. Although Rowling\\'s writing and the wizarding world is as enjoyable as always, HBP is over-long and with not much plot; it\\'s basically a place-holder in the series. Forced to finally admit that Voldemort is back and again on the rise to power, the Ministry of Magic and the magical world are in an uproar. The magical community is finally starting to side with Harry and Dumbledore, at last believing that things are in disarray, and acting accordingly. But school must go on for Harry and Co., and while there are no O.W.L.s looming, classes are still as demanding as ever. Add to that Harry\\'s private lessons with Dumbledore, where he learns as much as he possibly can about his arch-nemesis in preparation for their epic prophesied showdown, and an altogether new Potions situation, and it\\'s all the Chosen One can do to keep it together, never realizing what dreadful and horrific events await at the end of the year. Seven years since the last book came out, I decided it was finally time for my 6th (I though it was 7th, alas) read-through, and my first time all the way through from start to finish. I think with these I\\'ll start by writing what I can remember about my initial thoughts and then review them properly. 9 YEARS AGO: Again, this book\\'s release was a most exciting and eagerly-anticipated event for me and my sister, and the bookstore midnight party (at which my artwork was featured) only increased our excitement. At the time this book affected me even more than OotP did, just with what happened, and how it happened. I loved how the kids were growing up, it was hard to find fault with the story, and at a certain point I felt I had to put the book physically down and take a moment to process what in the wizarding world had just happened. THIS YEAR: After all these years I can look at this book objectively and say that it\\'s not among my favorites. It has a LOT of great things going for it, and it has plenty of drama and thrills and humor, but there\\'s something about it that feels kind of like an in-between story, like it\\'s just marking time and dropping information before the final chapter (which I guess it is, though I don\\'t think it HAS to feel that way). As usual, the storytelling is compelling and there\\'s some vivid descriptions of new characters and settings, and the characters are in top form, though evolving as people do when they stop being children and start growing toward adulthood. This is by far the steamiest book in the series, with much more emphasis on romance (read: hormones) and dating than ever before, which is natural, and which doesn\\'t really seem to distract from the overall plot, in fact it rather enhances it. Sure, some of the kids break character now and then, but I think that happens in real life when young people start to notice and attract/be attracted to those of the opposite sex. One of the great things about this book is that Ginny finally starts to come into her own. She started to show some spirit in the fifth book, but this is when she really emerges as a force to be reckoned with. I feel like the tent-pole scenes with Harry and Dumbledore in the Pensieve are placed just right and given just the right amount of attention, revealing plenty of intriguing clues and information about Voldemort\\'s past without dragging on. I really like how much it starts to tie in so many things from previous books, especially CoS, and adds a lot of little touches that make the whole thing seem really cohesive (whether those touches were planned during the writing of the earlier books or not). It starts to give the series a real feeling of cohesion with bookend elements. There are a few well-placed twists (new DADA teacher?? ), and though the mystery itself isn\\'t as engaging as some in previous books (eurgh, too much Snape), but it keeps the story moving along and adds some nice drama. Some parts drive me a little crazy (like the continued complete ineptitude of the Ministry and how the lead-up to the finale basically ends up meaning nothing, and also of course how Dumbledore is incredibly presumptuous and still unnecessarily secretive, and of course Snape), but it continues the mood established in the fifth book and builds up nicely to what we could only have guessed would be the most glorious and satisfying finale in all history of literature. (Was it?... Stay tuned to find out.) In the end, this book is a lot about Snape, and I really don\\'t like Snape. It\\'s also a lot about Voldemort, who I also don\\'t love, but I guess it\\'s pretty important to find out stuff about him. This one feels sort of like a rest stop in the series, but it does a good job of bridging the fifth book and the finale, while our favorite magical now-definitely-teenagers continue to weave their way through the winding walkways of life and learning and (oh yes) love. march 2014: just reread. one of the best things about book 6 is that harry is not the annoying, moody boy of book 5. i also like that we learn a lot more about a lot of characters outside of the main trio. urprises:  this book reminded me that ginny is much more awesome in the books than in the movies. ut i\\'m not sure that i understand what a bat-bogey hex is... to boogers with bat wings fly at you?  the possibility that voldemort actually cursed the defense against the dark arts position when he was denied it.  i love that arthur weasley\\'s dearest ambition is to figure out how airplanes stay up. This was the first book I ever read twice. I had to read it again right before I got the last book. Relative to Books 3, 4, and 5, Book 6 doesn\\'t contain a lot of action. Rather, there is a wealth of conversation, of human connection (and disconnection), of uncertainty and, most importantly, revelation. I certainly don\\'t mean any of this in a negative way - I was halfway through the book before I knew it, gobbling up the exquisite plotting and story. So many layers of subterfuge and distrust and confusion were sown throughout, many coming to a head, others only beginning to see the light of day, saving themselves for that final chapter in the series. Harry and the reader together learn many fascinating and mysterious things over the course of the book, and the dearth of action does not seem so great a burden, lulled as we are into the realm of discovery and understanding, before everything ultimately implodes in more than one gripping, astonishing, unbelievable burst at the end. I wrote in my review of Book 5 that Harry finally experienced consequences for his actions. In this entry, he progresses even further down the path to adulthood by learning that there is always something below the surface, that he is not protected, that he can be at once right and terribly wrong. (However, he still hasn\\'t learned to give more credence to Hermione\\'s theories, which would\\'ve saved him some trouble.) He also discovers, somewhat to his surprise, that despite all he has lost, he still has his friends. His childhood now decisively over, Harry faces his uncertain future with the boldness and bravery of Gryffindor - and with both love and hate in his heart. I usually take a little break between each Harry Potter book, to contemplate things for a bit. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be able to with this one. Goodness, I feel for those who had to wait a whole year after this ending... Overall, I liked this a lot more than the previous installment. I enjoyed the mostly slower pace, and seeing more interaction with Dumbledore. I did think that the title (and reveal of the Prince\\'s identity) was ultimately a bit anti-climactic. I\\'m not sure if it was supposed to be a red herring and I was supposed to think it was someone else or what. Oh well. I don\\'t know, after book 4 it just seemed to me that J.K. Rowling didn\\'t enjoy writing any more. The plot feels forced and heavy. Also, why did Harry\\'s dad had to be such a bully? That he wasn\\'t perfect, sure, but as he is discribed here you just can\\'t like him anymore. Oh my goodness. I definitely never read this one on my first read when these books were all released. If I did, I 100% do not remember anything that happened in this book. I feel that this was the most intense one of the series so far. Can\\'t wait to read the last one! I feel like this is a Harry Potter book that I know least well. I\\'m sure I\\'ve read it is many times so we read the others but I just feel like I don\\'t know the story of the characters involved in the same way as I do with the other books. Maybe that\\'s because I haven\\'t seen the film many times, in fact I think I\\'ve only seen it twice, or maybe it\\'s that this book just feel very different. For me this book is like an onion, and as much as it hurts me to quote Shrek, it has many layers to peel back and to investigate. I like the in-depth analysis into what makes Voldemort tick. I like finding more about his past and how this is shaped the very situation that are well known characters find themselves in. Most of all, I like changing pace and feel. The characters really feel like they\\'re coming of age, like they\\'re old enough to understand what\\'s going on I might actually now have the tools and the life experience to battle everything they\\'re going to face. And thus begins the most disheartening \"beginning of the end.\" I hate to admit that I never read this book when the series was released; this was my loss because this book is outstanding. The intricacy of the plot is admirable in and of itself, but this book also sets the seventh book up perfectly, all while continuing critical character and story development. There was so much backstory I missed with the sixth movie, so I was so glad to get it in the book -- particularly Voldemort\\'s history. And speaking of, this book certainly keeps in line with the pattern of the series becoming progressively darker; in the Half-Blood Prince readers are thrust into increasingly dismal and tragic territory. I was crying by the end of it. I think this book may be competing for a top slot in my rankings... P.S. I fully recognize that at this point that virtually everyone has read this series and has their own opinions. My reviews on these books aren\\'t intended to add anything new to the discussion; they\\'re largely for my own reference, so I can remember which aspects of which books I enjoyed :) Reread Dec 31st, 2016 - bumped up to 5 stars because Harry Potter The last Harry Potter book I read was The Half-Blood Prince. I\\'d already seen the movie, so I skipped this one and tried reading Deathly Hallows. I couldn\\'t remember a whole lot of the movie aside from the final few scenes. Re-reading it was an interesting experience but I can see why it wasn\\'t really that interesting. After reading Order of the Phoenix, I noticed how long the books dragged on. The plot has a lot of filler and often dodges the main storyline or tends to dedicate entire chapters to seemingly minor details down to Harry\\'s new annoying house elf, an examination at the new minister of muggles, Ginny\\'s new love interest and the Half-Blood Prince himself, who has a seemingly minor role in this book. Even though the book is named after him, it didn\\'t seem to be the main focus at all here. The story focuses on a few main things: Professor Slughorn\\'s long-forgotten memory of Voldemort, Malfoy\\'s secretive shenanigans and the identity of the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. Like I said, the Half-Blood Prince himself feels rather unimportant, in particular to the other two dilemmas. The first one, Professor Slughorn\\'s memory, involves Harry making several feeble attempts to appeal to him. The latter dilemma doesn\\'t seem very out of the ordinary. Throughout the entire series, Malfoy has always been a rather suspicious character and casting him for a villain was bound to happen sooner or later. However, seeing Malfoy as an actual villain makes me uncomfortable, especially in comparison to Voldemort. Malfoy comes across as the obnoxious school bully - who\\'s had minimal character development past six books - rather than the big bad evil being to be feared. At most, he\\'s just an annoying sidekick who should get kicked around. I suppose that overall, these main questions were my main gripe with the book. It seemed that the entire book was built up for the twist ending and that there were only two important points in the book: Voldemort\\'s secret and the dramatic ending. While building up to it is inevitable, it seems that over 600 pages worth of build-up is largely uneeded. On a side note, Snape\\'s character was one of the more interesting endeavors of the book. We tend to get vague clues as to whether or not he is good or evil. This book explores that idea a lot more, though it tends to gravitate towards evil much more. Of course, this has already been going on through the last couple books anyways, so there\\'s nothing terribly new. Though many will disagree with me, Harry comes off as a Mary Sue, or in this case, a Gary Stu. He inherits all of Sirius\\' old possessions (and gracefully doesn\\'t want one of the buildings he\\'d owned), is credited for saving half of Ron\\'s family and gets attention from plenty of girls trying to get into the Slug Club. He also happens to be Dumbledore\\'s favorite student and the most adept person in his Potions class. On a side note, somebody did reveal how the naming of the characters in the first book seemed to come off as a cheap trick. For example, Malfoy\\'s mom is named Narcissa, which sounds a lot like Narcissus. Fenrir Greyback is a werewolf, and his name is an allusion to a wolf god in Norse mythology. Another wolf, Lupin, has his name sound strikingly similar to Lupus, one of the scientific names for dogs. To me, it does seem a bit cheap. I mean, it\\'s cool to allude to mythology, but in real terms, how many Fenrirs were destined to grow up to be werewolves? To put it in better terms, it reminds me of Cruella DeVille from 101 Dalmatians, whose name is clearly meant to resemble cruel devil on account of how evil she is. Anyways, much like Order of the Phoenix, this book tends to drag on a bit more than it really should, but the last few ending chapters are rewarding and help set the dramatic stage for the final book, Deathly Hallows. It gives some interesting insight into Voldemort\\'s history and features one of the most dramatic moments in all of Harry Potter history. In spite of everythingb, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a yr=ear or ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with ron and hermione. The end was so sad:c One of the great books in a great series - funny, filled with adventure, with a shocking ending. Escapist literature doesn\\'t get better than this. Omg I could not put this down! FREAKING SNAPE OMG AND DUMBLEDORE AND THE FEELS AND UGHHH Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermoine are the real ships to sail that\\'s all I\\'m saying Harry still annoyed the hell out of me though. I loved it and I want the next one immediately but I\\'m prepared for tears. Sorry if this review is a mess. My heart is dead forever The entire wizarding world knows of Voldemort\\'s return. As Harry Potter returns for his sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he knows that things will be different this year. Dumbledore has special plans that require Harry\\'s secrecy as together they plumb the depths of Voldemort\\'s past in the hopes of finding a way to defeat him. This book has less angsting than the previous book did. It is easy to get drawn into the tale of Voldemort\\'s past and aside from Harry stalking Draco for half the book, this was pretty enjoyable. I haven\\'t read this for a while now and all I really remember of the movie is that they took out a lot of what made this book interesting. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would and even knowing the ending I still had a blast rereading it. The penultimate book of a well-crafted series. ***Reading Challenge 2016: A book with a first name in the title*** First, imagine someone driving a dull, rusted dagger through your chest. Your skin is all torn up, possibly irreparably damaged and deformed, and the pain is unlike anything you\\'ve ever felt before. Now imagine someone whom you love dearly taking that dagger and twisting it slowly and then ripping it out of your chest before doing the same with your heart. Imagine them crushing it before your very eyes. Imagine the hurt, the betrayal and the heartache you\\'d feel. That\\'s how I feel right now. I\\'m completely torn apart and heartbroken. Who knew a book could affect my emotions so drastically. (Well, I did, but that\\'s besides the point.) umbledore\\'s death , though I\\'d expected it because of spoilers I stumbled across online, still came as a shock to me. arry has witnessed so much loss and grief, firsthand... And to think Snape  was the one who did it! After all those semi-spoilers I saw of him turning out to be a hero or whatever, learning that he had done it was crippling. I suspect I\\'ll only feel more heartache as I continue with Deathly Hallows. I\\'m ready for the pain:)))) And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure. **Spoilers Alert . This is the only Harry Potter Book that I didn\\'t review yet, the sole reason is that the end was marvelous, amazing , that I just didn\\'t wait to write the review and started the deathly hallows instantly . however I loved The Deathly Hallows and didn\\'t wait to write this book\\'s review to express my whole ocean of feelings about it . So, somehow the review was never written , but no damage done because one of the Harry Potter perks is that not even a tiny detail is ever Forgettable . The story starts as always with the Dursleys . this time Dumbledore has a trip for Harry before he settles in the burrow and then back to Hogwarts . as the events progresses Harry is lent a potions book by Professor Slughorn, an old friend of Dumbledore\\'s who they convince to step by their side and eventually teach potions in Hogwarts . in the book Harry finds a number of notes from it\\'s previous owner, which allows Harry to excel in a subject he has never been more than average at. The book is marked \"Property of the Half-Blood Prince\". Who\\'s this half blood prince , the potions brilliant ? Hermione is slightly suspicious but they have too many other things in mind to bother much about it . Harry is a little affronted by Dumbledore\\'s disinterest in his doubts and fears . anyways soon we\\'d be introduced to what\\'s called Horcruxes  and dive in their mysteries . I love this book , its fast paced , nothing seems safe anymore , everything is at risk even Hogwarts that has always been the safe haven . its quite dark at places . the flashbacks that tell us about Voldemort\\'s / Tom Riddle\\'s past is so absorbing . I always like to read the stories of the villains , I like to know what led them to be whatever they are . Also in this book we can notice that Rowling seems to be trying for more complicated prose and more sophisticated storytelling than each of her previous books . There are plenty of questions left unanswered by the end and We also learn a lot more about the characters, We even see whole other sides of them , maybe change our model thinking about them . Draco Malfoy is one of these . The final plot twist , which is Dumbledore\\'s killer identity is absolutely unforeseen even shocking {if it\\'s not spoiled for you , off course } and Dumbledore\\'s death overall is devastating , the one who was always been there to solve problems , the background Hero , their savior , the strongest wizards in the world\\'s Death puts everything at stake . His death is one of the most emotional . The only two deaths that made me cry were Dumbledore\\'s and Dobby\\'s . Though I have to admit that if I had the choice to bring one character to life that most definitely would be Fred , but when I say emotional I mean that we had time to cry , to mourn our loss . Fred \\'s , Sirius\\'s , Lupin\\'s , Tonks\\'s . All these deaths happened in the middle of a battle , in the middle of a sentence we had no time to feel them fully at the time .But Later they\\'d hurt when Re-reading the books or when thinking about the whole image but while reading You\\'d feel Dumbledore\\'s and Dobby\\'s the most . At least that\\'s what happened with me . Yes ! off course Dobby is still alive here , also all the other characters above but I am generally speaking . All in all , its a Harry Potter Book , That\\'s an enough compliment , I loved it as much as I loved all the other books maybe slightly more than few others . *Peace upon your hearts You who are going to read the deathly Hallows . Get yourselves ready , you\\'d need self control and tissues , Yes paper tissues you\\'d need that * READ IT HERE Recensione su: http://wp.me/p3X6aw-4x Review on: http://wp.me/p3X6aw-4x To my mind, this episode in the HP saga shows Harry at his most complex. The romance with Ginny that everyone hoped was coming finally gets a kick in the pants, he is given a new leadership role (Quidditch captain) while also engaging in dubious behavior. He experiences moments of empathy toward Voldemort and Draco Malfoy while clinging tightly to his distaste for Severus Snape. And in the final pages he is launched on his final quest to take place in the seventh book. Best bits (back to Dumbledore): \"Ah... how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute.\" (Dumbledore, 359) \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\" (Dumbledore, 510) It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. (Dumbledore, 566) Wow, it\\'s been a while since I read this the first time. We learn so much more about Voldemort. I am still clinging tenaciously to my trust of Snape, though it is difficult. I am hoping that Dumbledore was right. Anyway, this is probably my 2nd favorite of the series so far. This story follows Harry\\'s exploits as he spirals closer and closer to what seems to be a murky and dark future. The writing is, as ever, superb and witty as you\\'re drawn into the darkness and depth of Harry\\'s world. Angrier and moodier, Harry\\'s suspicions grow ever wilder as he tries to piece together the actions and behaviors of his school \\'enemies\\' and the frustration that comes with not being listened to or taken seriously. This book really brings to light Harry\\'s compassion and lets us see how he realizes that all is not always what it seems. Brillant plotting, fun and scary all at once. J K Rowling is a genius. Read Jan 2010 - Feb 2010 Read Jan 2011 - Feb 4/11 Read Jan 2012 - Feb 4/12 Read Jan 11/13 - Jan 29/13 Read Feb 28/14 Read Jan 4/16 - Jan 25/16 I\\'d say smthg but I don\\'t want to spoil it for shqiponja I need a moment... Maybe a day, but knowing me I won\\'t give myself any and I\\'ll start reading the deathly Hallows any minute now The story plot was very interesting. I actually really liked it. I stopped reading though, because the book was making me frustrated and annoyed. Harry and his friend\\'s attitudes about the things they went through and the inconclusive resolve of the issues they faced just grated on me. I\\'m generally affected by the feelings of others and even the feelings of fictional characters. I wanted to finish the series, but when it was making me so frustrated and upset, it didn\\'t seem wise to continue. Having finished most of the books, I will say that the things I most disliked about the book were the \"promotion\" of disobedience. Harry really didn\\'t get punished...almost ever, for doing almost every single thing that should have gotten him expelled from the school. Well, I guess he did get detention, but the book always seemed to portray such occurrences as unwarranted and unfair. I understand that Harry might have seen it that way, but that doesn\\'t mean that the whole attitude of the book should reflect Harry\\'s immature focus. The other things I didn\\'t like were the absence of Ginny and the wallowing in depressing feelings. The first I disliked because, well, who doesn\\'t want to see more about the main character and the person they eventually marry? Plus, the whole not-including-Ginny, to me at least, gave me the impression (which I hated having) that Harry simply liked Ginny because she really liked him and cared about him, not because he saw something in her. As to the wallowing in feelings, I simply didn\\'t like that because it affect me emotionally and frustrated me. What I did like: The plot was great. It didn\\'t remind me of anything I\\'d already read. I like reading something that seemed so entirely \"new\", something I couldn\\'t exactly guess every new turn. It stayed interesting and never really seemed to drag on. Powerful. GD, J.K. Rowling! First you kill Sirius Black, and if I just read that chapter correctly, Snape has just made a vow to kill freakin\\' Dumbledore? That the H? This is both the best and worst HP so far! I loved it and thought it was by far the best.....and then. Well you know what happened. I now think it is the worst (but still kind of the best. Gah!). Im so sad :( Just finished the audio book. Was very good. Though I don\\'t like the way Jim Dale does Ginny\\'s voice. But other than that, a fantastic audio book. On to Deathly Hallows! Much better. Things really took off in the end, and I liked the added romance in this one. Ready for the last book! This book is nice, but not my favorite out of all series. But still nice. \"It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world\" After reading this I need time to emotionally recuperate but at the same I need to read the last one. This book just made me feel so many FEELS. It was beautifully sorrowful, yet exciting and I JUST LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT Dumbledore dies, everybody cries So many tears. I have read a version of this that was somehow half the size, and I can say, the longer one was better. The plot was fairly good, the characters were fairly annoying. Altogether, there was way to much kissing. It was disgusting. Another excellent re-read of a favourite. Re-read october 2017: HBP has always been my least favorite of the Harry Potter novels, maybe because of the added darkness and slowness... most of the novel is about Harry trying to figure out what Draco Malfoy is up to and not being able to let it go. Though, even if it\\'s my least favorite, it still contains the magic of the HP novels. ike the continuous hinting about Snape being the Half-Blood Prince , the friendships and the magic of Hogwarts. And, one of the best sassy Harry moments of them all: There\\'s no need to call me \\'sir\\', Professor. I gave this a 9/10 for the sheer fun of enjoying reading it. For me, Harry Potter stopped being fun with the last book and it was good to get that back again. However, when I stop to think about it (or listen to my husband talking about the book), there really wasn\\'t a lot of plot here. I enjoyed at adventure, but we didn\\'t progress the overall story very far. I don\\'t want to spoil this for anyone (one major event was spoiled for me and I was very annoyed about it) which means I can\\'t really go into what I thought about some of the details, forcing this to be a particularly short review. But I guess mostly I enjoyed the story and I\\'ll wait to see if my quibbles are going to be resolved in the last book before complaining too loud. [Copied across from Library Thing; 16 October 2012] A great book continuation on the Harry Potter series. It\\'s nice that everyone believes him now, it drove me bonkers in the fifth. Even though the ending was sad, it went right with the seventh novel. OH MY CLARK GABLE I CANNOT EVEN RIGHT NOW, NO ONE TALK TO ME. Re-reading this book for the first time since it\\'s initial launch was an absolute joy. Somewhere over the years the last three Potter books had merged in my mind into an angst filled, bloated ending to the series that while still being excellent was a definite drop off from the early books. While Order Of The Phoenix confirmed this feeling The Half-Blood Prince tore it apart. Seemingly learning from some of the missteps in Phoenix, Rowling reigns things in a bit here, creating a more focused narrative while still having enough space to develop some of the relationships which come to define the series. Prince absolutely retains the magical feeling and mystery filled storytelling of the early books while telling a darker tale. While it lacks some of the social commentary from Phoenix I feel it\\'s a very worthwhile trade off. I really want to give this 1star because of the end. But I can\\'t. I just finished this and I can\\'t even write a proper review right now. This book deserves to sit in the corner and think about what it\\'s done. I\\'m just going to go cry now. Maybe for a couple of days. And Harry, YOU IDIOT. GINNY AND YOU ARE PERFECT. Hopefully Lupin got it together and came to his senses and he and Tonks will be together. Yeah. Silly, foolish Harry, thinking it was Tonks and Sirius. I never believed it. But finally, a DADA teacher has stayed! I seriously am just going to cry now. This is probably my least read Harry Potter book, and I had a really good time going through and re-reading it! I think its the perfect transion book to get us to where we need to be in book 7, without overwhelming us with too many new plot details. In fact its a much simpler story than both GoF and OOTP, but I think thats what it needed to b. I really loved going through all of Dumbledors memories again, and of course the part when they are they are in the cave always makes me shiver! This might actually top the Deathly Hallows simply because of character development. Sure, we got answers to our questions in Deathly Hallows, but this one we got to learn about Voldemort and compare him to Harry, and I love learning the origin story of the villain. Totally loved it !! My favorite volume of the series, in both book and movie. LOVE. This was simultaneously my favorite and my least favorite of the series, and this was because it seemed to be split into two entirely different books. On one side of the split, we\\'re finally getting answers about the origins of Voldemort and fleshing out the central action-plot. On the other side, it\\'s like reading a fanfic by a sixteen-year-old. One of the things I liked best about Rowling\\'s style in the earlier books was that she was able to stay above her fans\\' need for romantic focus. In the sixth book, whenever Harry wasn\\'t gallivanting through memories with Dumbledore, he and the other characters were entirely wrapped up in a Degrassi-style teenage soap opera. Frankly, it cheapened the characters I\\'d grown to love. My feelings on this book are half-and-half. I loved the Harry and Dumbledore scenes, but I could have done without the hormones. 4 1/2 Stars. Where the previous installment relies heavily on rousing emotions to propel it forward, this one relies more on rousing curiosity. The result is a nicely calm albeit lengthy bridge from the intense emotions that accompany a large chunk of the Order of the Phoenix to the intense emotions that end the Half-Blood Prince. Beyond that, I cannot say much of what I have not already said in reviews of previous books in the series. Rowling continues to constrict my heart and wring out my eyes with her emotional shockers, and her ingenious development of characters has honestly put me at a loss for words. I am all-together eager, anxious, enthusiastic, and terrified to read the final book. Wow that was so good. I still don\\'t like this one as much as the others. it honestly seemed like there were a number of different plotlines going on, which is okay, I guess, but they weren\\'t really related and they were bouncing around quite a lot. It was good that the climax held for all of them, though. Thsi book could just have easily been called \\'Harry Potter and his friend\\'s sister\\', \\'Harry Potter and Malfoy is up to SOmething\\', \\'Harry Potter and the History of Voldemort\\', \\'harry Potter and dumbledore is actually telling harry something for a change\\', \\'Harry Potter and Ron\\'s crush\\', \\'Harry potter and the quidditch cup\\', or \\'Harry Potter and Hermione is right, as usual\\'. It was about these other things just as musch as it was about teh half-Blood prince, possibly more. I admit, Harry got over many of his flaws in this one. He stopped yelling at everyone all teh time, he told people the stuff they needed to know, he stopped crushing on Cho Chang. All issues I had with him in former books. But it did seem a bit like he matured all at once. Which doesn\\'t happen. I\\'m glad he got with Ginny, though. And Ron\\'s reaction was perfect. I would have liked a little more showing what actually happened, there was a lot of \"this week was great\", \"he was thinking about a nice hour he had spent\" \"he was very happy\"...etc. I would have liked a little more of it actually happening and a little less telling in retrospect. I was dissapointed in this climax. Not only was it dissapointing no matter how well it was written, but i was dissapointed in the futileness of the Horcrux thing. Also i thought that the climax was odly detached form the rest of the book. it was kind of llike \"Oh lets go have a climax...GO\" It didn\\'t even try to ease into it. plus it bugs me that everyone is wrong, becasue i like there to be someone that is right in teh story, but when Harry, Hermione, and Professor McGonagall are all wrong, there is something going on. One Note: This sounds naive. but why doesn\\'t The portrait of Dumbledore count for anything? Don\\'t portraits have memories, knowledge, and the ability to talk? Can\\'t Dumbledore\\'s Portrait just keep on being headmaster and giveing harr his lessons? What is the difference??? I am having issues with this. One rant: IT IS NEVER SNAPE!!!! WHEN WILL THE ENTIRE CAST GET THIS THROUGH THEIR THICK SKULLS?? and why couldn\\'t there at least be one person who is still sure he\\'s good. That would ahve been better. I wish Hermione\\'s and Ron\\'s stupid arguments didnt\\' have to last entire books. That is not realistic. If you stay mad at eachother that long, you aren\\'t making up. This was like 7 months, which is amplified in Boarding school time. It doesn\\'t work like that. And why are they both so stupid and selfish. They need to be there for Harry!! They are causing him just one more source of anxiety that he sure as heck doesn\\'t need right now. They need to buck up and be there for Harry, whether they are besties or not. Or jsut fall in love already. That would be good too. Is there a difference between a hex, a curse, and a jinx? because I thought they were all sort of slightly different, distinct things, but they seem to be used interchangebly. Apparently I read this pretty quickly? Well, there\\'s a reason for that: it was great! It totally redeemed the last book, as this novel was far more exciting, had less aggravating characters, and it wasn\\'t as depressing as its predecessor (ok, the ending actually made me sad, I will admit, though I knew it was coming before I even read the series). There was one aspect of the novel that made me scoff quite a few times, and that was the teenage drama. Now, not to say that I wasn\\'t the same way when I was in high school (you know, shy to ask someone out, obsessing over the one tiny smile the cute guy gave me), but when you\\'re 27, like I am, you just want to tell 16-year-olds to \"ASK THEM OUT FOR LOVE OF ZEUS\". Seriously, it\\'s not a big deal at all. Hell, when you\\'re my age you can tell if someone wants in your pants just by catching their eye and raising an eyebrow. But when you\\'re 16, it is a big deal to tell someone you fancy them. And Rowling did a great job making their little dramas entirely realistic and therefore endearing. I think there was just enough of the drama to make Harry and friends out to be typical teenagers (because if they were all stoics and not interested in making out it would be laughably unrealistic), but not enough that I shook the book and was like \"ENOUGH ALREADY.\" h, and I totally called Tonks being in love with Lupin , but that\\'s probably because I have a wee crush on him myself! ANYWAY, drama aside, the book moved at a great pace. Clearly I couldn\\'t put it down. Likewise, the last hundred pages was a great climax - a mystery was solved, another mystery was introduced, a battle took place... and as such, it was a really good precursor to the last book. Hell, I\\'m going to start Deathly Hallows as soon as I\\'m done work. A couple things were a little obvious. The identity of the Half-Blood Prince? igured that out from the get-go (I mean, come on, who else would have the time [due to having no friends] to annotate an entire book, and who else grew up to become the POTIONS professor? ). And despite what he did, this particular character still tugs on my heartstrings. I wish I had read this series years ago. This may be my favorite Harry Potter book. I love the sections with Voldemort\\'s backstory - they really help you understand him. Learning about the Horcruxes is really shocking, for the reader as much as Harry. It\\'s nice to see Harry and Dumbledore\\'s trust in each other grow (sob). I also like that everyone finally pairs up in this book, even if it\\'s after some angst (the Ron and Lavender scenes always make me laugh). The mystery of the identity of the half-blood prince - and the reveal at the end - also elevate the book, as does the tension-filled climax in the cave. And of course, the end is just so sad. It still breaks my heart, even after having reread it many times. The book does a good job setting up everything for the grand finale! #cryingrealtears It\\'s still not easy to read this even when you know it\\'s coming because you\\'ve read it before...multiple times.... Re-reading before the Cursed Child\\'s release on 7/31/16! ** spoiler alert ** Heartbreaking and Fabulous (Best BOOK,WORST movie) +Half-Blood Prince is my favorite book and other than 7, the darkest book in the series. though each is a masterpiece. Full of great moments in the story. I felt that I was learning more and at a quicker rate than in Order of the Phoenix. +It must be that Rowling, in her grand scheme, is saving much for the last book. One thing seems to be for certain, though, and that is that J.K. Rowling will never lose that special touch, that supreme and genuine interest in the story and its characters that makes the writing so engrossing. After completing this book, I was in a state of total shock and to this moment I wish only to read the seventh book. +Half-Blood Prince is dark; I mean far darker than the last. Several of the chapters are particularly well-written, with great suspense and imagery;Relationships blossom in this book at last, haha i will not TELL,BUT i was engrossed in Harry\\'s LOVE LIFE,at the same time disappointed haha LOL because it\\'s a bit short,not just Harry\\'s LOVE STORY but other CHARACTERS as well. +Much of the book is devoted to Harry witnessing important memories in the Pensieve with Dumbledore so that he can gain a greater understanding of his enemy, the Dark Lord. +Revealing more on SNAPE\\'S story.hmmm,i\\'m a bit fan of Severus Snape,though i HATE him for DOiNG SOMETHING REALLY REALLY BAD & unexpected, T_T RESULTiNG of MOST SHOCKING PART of this book.One of the MAiN CHARACTER DIED.I was so sad & teary-eyed,to the point i READ again that part not believing it really happened. I was expecting a surprising reason for Dumbledore to trust Snape, not a simple apology. There must still be more to this than meets the eye. +The end of the book is unbelievably sad and depressing.When you grow with Harry Potter it\\'s definitely a blast. +If you haven\\'t guessed my opinion on \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" yet, I\\'ll say that I highly recommend it. Run to get your copy, if you don\\'t already have one, and share the magic :) +LASTLY, +\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" is amazing. It is mature and moving and is by far the best book in the series so far. There are a lot of open-ended questions that are leading up to Book Seven...will Harry and his friends return to Hogwarts for their final year? Will there even be a Hogwarts to go back to? How on earth will Harry manage the impossible task that lies ahead of him? One thing\\'s for certain...I can\\'t wait to find out! Blimey!! Let\\'s READ the LAST PART of the BOOK Shall we??? or not?? ** spoiler alert ** This might be my favorite in the series, but the jury is out on that since I\\'ve read the last one only once, and I flew through it so fast I can barely remember parts of it. As for this book, the snogging stuff gets a little annoying, but the overall story is great. This book also has my favorite scene in the series which is where Snape hands Harry his ass in a duel. Snape is probably my favorite character in the series overall, and he\\'s featured rather prominently in this one. Reread the ending and it kills me every time... 7th book of 2017 - (5 stars) ~finished february 8, 2017~ still great :) update: february 8, 2017 honestly still don\\'t understand why people didn\\'t love this book. i loooooooved it <3 also the goodreads rereading function-thanks :) update: march 6, 2016: reading this series again in the wrong order makes me happy :) HP re-read 2015. This is one of my faves in the series. And still brings me to tears. Probably the best of the Potter books. Cried at the end all over again. Maybe it\\'s the Harry Potter Book with biggest revelation and maddest turn of event. Personally, I will always think of this book as the account of Harry\\'s last year in Hogwarts. This book is when I feel like the series started to take a majorly dark turn. It\\'s so intense and depressing at some points (you all know exactly which part it is too) but as with all of the books, it still keeps me enthralled and wanting more. Just great, adored this books like the others. Harry Potter will always be a series that I\\'ll never get tired of rereading and this is only the second time I read it, the first time was in French, my native language. (I\\'m not an English-speaking don\\'t hesitate to correct me if needs be) Reread Sept. Harry goes about this tome with: Malfoy-Ginny-Prince-Malfoy-Quiddich-Prince-Malfoy-Ginny-Quidditch-Voldemort\\'s origin story-Teen Angst-Quiddich-Ginny-Malfoy... And in the usual JKR style, last 5 chapters is where things happen and end. Sept 4, 2017 - finished on audio. This one went very fast (also helped along by a road trip), and Jim Dale got to do many characters in younger form during flashbacks. The whole last couple hours of this were so harrowing. \"And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour--or possibly several sunlit days--they broke apart.\" [Harry thinks] how they had talked about fighting a losing battle, and that it was important to fight, and to fight again, and to keep fighting, to keep evil at bay, though never quite eradicated. \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\" \"There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to fear from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" July 2007-ish: Okay, I\\'m now at the point everyone else was at when they couldn\\'t wait for midnight on July 21!! Although I\\'d already heard who dies at the end of this 6th book, I managed not to hear how it happens, and I was shocked -- shocked! This story is getting really scary (for a wimp like me), and certain scenes I wished I wasn\\'t reading alone at night! But lucky me, I get to open book 7 RIGHT NOW and not wait two years for closure! Here goes... You know. It\\'s just good. Favorite Quotes Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths. Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. This is me now. Of course I don\\'t have a Damon - shoulder to cry on but still... So far this is my favourite HP book. It was so good, such a fast read and it made me laugh cringe and cry. I am so sad that my journey is almost over. But hey I have book 8 soon. I can\\'t believe I am onto book 7 already. Full review to come Oh and poor Hagrid and Fang. I hope all works out fine( hopefully) o sad on Dumbledore\\'s death. o sad.  can\\'t. nape I hate you. hocked about Harry and Ginny emus and Tanks??!! re-read. I dislike Harry and Ginny getting together. One second he thinks her name and suddenly he likes her? I don\\'t get it. Besides that, everything else was wonderful Buddy Re-Read continues! I read this last almost the day after it originally came out and was amazed at the big reveals... Guess who Dies and guess who the Prince is! ... but more than that, I was pretty blah and then very enthused as we learned more and more and more and more about Mr. Riddle as Harry kept sticking his head under water. It was a hate/love relationship for me. I wanted to know about our big bad. I really did. And then I also wanted to just get over all the cleverly-installed flashbacks and get on with the freaking story. That was before the movie. And so the movie came out and I was all like... Where is all the backstory for Voldemort? This is hardly anything! This is just a brief little taste! How are we supposed to feel the deep revulsion AND pity for the man if we can\\'t get more screen time for him??? And so I fell BACK on the bandwagon for all those pretty flashbacks. Ah, the trials and tribulations of a fanboy. This is like knowing Frank Herbert\\'s Dune inside and out and then watching the Lynch mindf*** and spending more than 3/4 of the movie filling in all the details that are left unsaid in the film that make the story deeper and more amazing than the acid trip that I was watching. Okay. Maybe the HP6 film wasn\\'t QUITE that bad and there were a lot of brilliant moments that were visual and direct link-ups to the main plot in the HP7 movies, so continuity was preserved very well. Still, the lack of time with Snape\\'s younger cursecrafting self and the lack of all the mystery subplot with Dumbledore, himself, made the end events kind of rushed and confusing within the movie. Not so at all within the book. The book was a real page-turner for me. Again. I love in-depth reasons. A lot. Still a great book! Reread January 2017 It\\'s been quite a long time since I\\'ve reread this book and there was so much about it that I had faint remembrance of that when I got to it felt like a breath of fresh air reading. The last time I read this I remember it hadn\\'t been one of my favorites for some reason but now that I\\'m revisiting it after some time I absolutely loved this one! Granted, I love every Harry Potter book but this is the first time I\\'ve read this one in a while and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Actual Rating: 4.5 Yeesh. This book was really, really close to not getting 5 stars, and while that sounds fine for any other book, this is Harry Potter we\\'re talking about here. It\\'s not supposed to be close to getting 4 stars. The ending was enough to satisfy me, though, because of... well, you know what. Just because of that, this book managed to sneak past and retain the record. I\\'m not going to let up too easy on the last book, though -- I generally have high expectations of conclusions. I remember from my first read-through of this series that I thought of the two final books as very unsatisfying, compared to the first five. Apparently I still think that, because I had two major issues with this book. One, it was on a bit of a rinse-and-repeat schedule. Everybody knows that\\'s not how Harry Potter goes. It\\'s supposed to be unexpected, and you\\'re not supposed to know what\\'s going to come up next. Two, the characters were starting to grate on my nerves. Like, seriously? Why do Ron and Hermione have to keep shifting back and forth? First they\\'re fine with each other, and then they hate each other so much they make purposeful moves so as not to even look at the other? Then suddenly they\\'re fine again? I get that \"teenage relationships\" go back and forth a lot, but seriously. Ron is so annoying. I\\'m sorry, but he is. I seriously want to punch him in the face. On the other hand, Dumbledore was my favorite character in this book. I\\'m well aware that J.K. Rowling was probably just building up angst because of what happens to him later... but still. He was a well-developed character in this book, and a character that rarely ever irritated me. And for that, I thank him. Also, the book was just so boring. As I previously stated, it was on a rinse-and-repeat schedule. Ron and Hermione either get into a fight or make amends. Things are mentioned about the \"Half-Blood Prince\", or classes. Then there\\'s another lesson with Dumbledore. Then brief things about Voldemort. Sometimes you get the occasional Quidditch. (Speaking of which, we played Quidditch in P.E. Monday. I was so hyped.) Then Ron and Hermione have another intense confrontation/conversation. Things are mentioned once again about the Half-Blood Prince, either that, or it\\'s something about Slughorn. Then we have brief mentions of how hard classes are. And we have another lesson with Dumbledore, which sends Harry into some brief state of euphoria. When I say brief, I mean brief. And then after that, people discuss about Voldemort, or something major centering either Voldemort or the Ministry of Magic is announced. (Yes, I consider Stan Shunpike\\'s arrest \"major\".) It just goes on... and on... and on... But there is a reason why it\\'s rated 5 stars. First of all, it really shows well the time of war going on. It shows how even in wartimes, life continues, and while I haven\\'t really experienced it, I can tell it from this book. There\\'s romance. There\\'s Fred and George\\'s popular wizard jokes shop, which is getting many customers even though the most powerful Dark wizard of all time is back. Alas, I still wish that we discussed more about the Order of the Phoenix (I mean, come on, last book was named after them), but I guess you can\\'t have everything. Too bad some of my favorite characters are in the Order of the Phoenix... Also, I found the ending incredible. I powered right through the ending, and it was so wonderfully written in a way that tugged at your heartstrings. Pretty decent book, I suppose. However, there\\'s a bit of a sour taste in my mouth from it, and I really only gave it 5 stars due to my reverie of the previous books. 4.5/5 it\\'s become better upon each reread, but I still think too much teen drama/romance bogged down the novel. Narcissa and Snape are the reasons why I rate the book so highly. I definitely appreciate Narcissa more now in hindsight, as well as Draco. ah, the cover... pensieve. Once again - so sad, yet so brilliant. The pacing was perfect, the plot was great, the characters are all amazing in their own way (aside, obviously, from Umbridge, even though she only appeared in about two sentences in this book), and J.K. Rowling is a genius. That is really all I have to say right now. I\\'m a little scared to start the final book, knowing what will come; but at the same time, I can\\'t wait to go on. I\\'m a little torn. (Knowing myself, I\\'ll be starting the next book tonight, anyway, or tomorrow at the earliest.) Merlin\\'s beard.... this book is definitely... Now I know why so many people say that J.K. Rowling is a living legend. She really knows her stuff. Warning: Spoilers are present in this review It was easier for me to immediately get into the central story in this one, mainly because Harry has stopped being as moody as he was in the Order of Phoenix, and that in itself made me like the sixth installment in this series more. I think that The Half Blood Prince might be my favorite one so far (just behind it is The Prisoner of Azkaban). I can\\'t really say why, but there was something that kept me so immersed in it that I had to stay up late to finish. That\\'s not to say that the others don\\'t possess the same quality - but even so, I felt it more here. It could just be the fact that I enjoyed the subplots more.Normally I don\\'t like it when there\\'s a lot of memories and flashbacks in a book, but J.K. Rowling unfolds everything so skillfully as always, and learning about Voldemort\\'s past was quite interesting to me. I suppose he had a bad childhood, so that could have contributed to his evilness, but overall I think he\\'s just crazy. It also answered something that had been puzzling me since the beginning of the Goblet of Fire - I didn\\'t get how three Riddles were murdered in their big house. But with the explanation midway into the novel it all made sense. I\\'ve learned to just go with the flo when it comes to the Harry Potter books, knowing that eventually I\\'ll have no more questions to ask. I always felt like Harry was right to keep such a close eye on Draco throughout his sixth year at Hogwarts, especially after everything he heard on the train. I found it a little odd that Ron and Hermione dismissed Harry\\'s serious suspicions about Draco so easily with the evidence that steadily kept piling up. I was surprised at the turn his character took, honestly. He\\'s always been a pest, yes, and definitely a worthy enemy of Harry\\'s, ever since the first book. Still, I was sad when he started working with the Death Eaters, and by the end of HP number six, I felt really bad for him. He probably felt like he had no choice, what with his whole family being on Voldemort\\'s side. That doesn\\'t excuse his actions, though. I\\'m curious to see what will become of him in the last one. I can honestly say that the HP books have the best secondary characters of any series I\\'ve ever read (and that\\'s quite a statement, coming from me. I like to think I\\'ve read a lot.) Almost all of them have made some kind of impression on me, whether they were good or bad. For example, I kind of love Luna, even though she hasn\\'t been around a whole lot, and was just introduced in the last book. She may be a little odd, but she has this open way of stating things; I\\'m really hoping for some kind of happy ending for her. All the Weasleys will always have a special place in my heart. I was, however, kind of surprised by Harry\\'s feelings for Ginny. They seemed to spring up very suddenly. I mean, they\\'ve known each other for over five years and he just now realizes that she\\'s pretty and awesome. I got used to it after a while, but I kind of wish the relationship had a little more development. I was really disappointed at first because Ginny was really quiet, and as close to a flat character as you can get in the HP books. But she actually showed some personality here, much more fiery than before. I was annoyed when Harry broke up with her at the end. It was obvious that Voldemort would use whoever Harry cared about against him, but he could just as easily use Ron or Hermione, and I didn\\'t see him ditching them. In both the books and the movies, I have seen tiny hints of feelings between Ron and Hermione. I think that they came out a lot more in this one. It was obvious after Hermione\\'s temper tantrum with the birds when Ron got together with Lavender (who was extremely annoying). On one hand I felt kind of bad for the both of them, but on the other I\\'ve gotten to the point where I\\'m just really frustrated with their dance-around-the-feelings thing. I think they\\'re pretty cute together, though I do wonder sometimes what made Rowling decide not to put two of her main characters together. The most heart-stopping, punch in the gut was definitely the end when Dumbledore died. I had some suspicion of it happening based off some comments I\\'d read in some reviews, but I was hoping against hope I was wrong and it wouldn\\'t happen. I had come to care for him so much as a character in this series that I was simply devastated upon reading about his demise. I actually had to put the book aside for a few minutes so I could cry about it; he was so wise and friendly, yet so powerful. I didn\\'t expect Draco to be the one to kill him in the tower based on the way he was already acting (he was crying earlier in the bathroom, after all), but I also didn\\'t think Snape would be the one to do it. Obviously I\\'ve always disliked him for his behavior towards Harry, but I was hoping he had really changed (though maybe some part of me thought he didn\\'t, even though five years had gone by without him murdering Harry). And the fact that Snape was the Half Blood Prince? I probably should have seen that coming, what with all the advice he gave coming out of a Potions book, but I really didn\\'t. I still don\\'t feel like I completely understand Snape\\'s character, but as of now I hate him for killing Dumbledore. This book was an excellent set-up for the final chapter, and though I want to put off reading it because it\\'s the last one, I know I won\\'t because I just have to see how this all ends immediately. I was just really annoyed with Dumbledore in this one Oh my gosh so many damn emotions this book. - We learn how and why Voldemort has been capable of living after going through so much. Horcruxs which contain small fragments of Voldemorts soul in each of them. We must destroy all the Horcruxs in order to destroy Voldemort!  The battle at Hogwarts...SO MANY FEELS. t first Dumbledore being brutally murdered by freaking SNAPE. ever should\\'ve trusted that many. nly for Hagrids hut to catch on fire and for Fang to nearly die! Such an intense scene. - Fleur and Bills love after the accident. The way the Weasleys finally realized that Fleur is more than just her appearance and that her love for Bill runs deep. They\\'re no longer teenagers dealing with mundane things. Voldemort is growing stronger as well as his following of death eaters. The books are taking a darker turn as the end is nearing. The students are all growing older and taking on more serious aspects of life. *sobs uncontrollably* Why yes it was a great book. The first time I read this book, I really didn\\'t like it that much. But ironically when I watched all the movies, this one was my favorite. So I think knowing that I enjoyed this movie the most, I actually ended up enjoying this book a lot more. eading Dumbledore\\'s death still made me super sad, but it was easier to get through this time around.  just remember being really shocked by it the first time. eing prepared really helped soften the blow from his death. I\"m glad I finally got around to reading this again so I can give it the appreciation it actually deserves. OMG, the ending always makes me cry! Could not put this down and a great improvement from length of the 5th novel in the series. Much less going on and much more to the point. #3 is still my favourite book but this would be a close second! Dark, witty and fairly fast paced, your left with thrills and hangers but they are resolved within a reasonable amount of time. The dashes of romance and humour add to a very gritty addition to the series. I cant wait to finish the final book. NOT ready for this reread to be over. I\\'m not sure when I\\'ll get to the 7th book but dammit these books are just as fantastic years later. (Duh.) Current favorites in order: 4,3,1,6,5,2 (I have a feeling 7 will fall towards the middle - I remember being bored during all the walking but the middle/end GAH) The great thing about rereading is that you visit a time in your life when you thought differently. For a long time I thought that Half-Blood Prince was my favorite of the Harry Potter books and now, 10 years later, as I read this one I loved it. I really really loved it, it\\'s a 5 star read but now I\\'m not sure if I can still call this my favorite of the Harry Potter books. I almost love The Order of the Phoenix more which is hilarious to me especially since for a long time OOtP was my least favorite of the books. It just shows you how we change. I had forgotten about 60% of what happens in this book so I have decided that I need to read the Harry Potter books every 3-4 years. I still laugh at the jokes and everything felt fresh and modern, these books have aged to incredibly well. I also have to commend Rowling for her \\'growing up\\' of Harry in this book as this is the book when Harry faces down the Minister of Magic all by himself with plenty of sass to go around. I had also forgotten just how awesome Ginny is, when Ginny came to the forefront of the books she was met with a lot of backlash - she was a sharp contrast to beloved Hermione which I felt was incredibly unfair to her since Rowling had YEARS to flesh out Hermione and since the books are told in Harry\\'s POV he just doesn\\'t notice Ginny until this book so we notice her as Harry notices her. The Mary-Sue term was stamped on her something fierce (a term I find both insulting and sexist). Rowling has such an uncanny ability to write female characters, even if all they get is a few lines, Tonks, Luna, Fleur and Mrs. Malfoy are a few that come to mind. I\\'m a little sad that I\\'m coming to the end of the books, I\\'ve enjoyed the reread so much and in these crazy political times they have been my happy place which I am incredibly grateful for. I knew what was coming. I knew what would happen. But I still cried. I insanely cried while I was in the bus travelling home. And I didn\\'t care. BRB, STILL CRYING. It all gets so sad and serious. *sobs* This book was awesome. I can\\'t believe all that is happening. I still see Harry, Hermione and Ron as 11 year olds but they aren\\'t and I\\'m dying to read the next book. I like how this series has gone from feeling like a simple story to being so involved and darker. You have to know it will become dark because of the premise of the story. I really love this telling of the classic good vs. evil. Reread ** spoiler alert ** Okay, okay, okay, let me get my thoughts together. First off, I have never cried so much because of a book. I was able to prevent myself from crying up until the funeral. I knew Dumbledore had died in this book but I was denying that it would happen. I just... people can still like Snape? I know in Deathly Hallows, Snape will probably say, \"I had to convince the Death Eaters that I was on their side, Dumbledore would\\'ve proudly died for this cause!\" I\\'m still in half-denial. On a lighter note, I have so many questions. First and foremost, I have been spoiled that Harry is a Horcrux, and I know the answer will be in Deathly Hallows, but... how? Won\\'t he have to destroy himself? Plus, who the heck is the person who has the locket? (I was so anxious throughout that scene; I felt that Dumbledore would die because there weren\\'t enough pages left in the book for it to be otherwise.) Side note: I volunteer to throw Draco Malfoy into the sun (and no, I would not like \"redeeming\" things to happen in Deathly Hallows. I don\\'t care if he fights against Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts.) I\\'m just now realizing how spoiled I have been for this series. I know the outcome of all the relationships, the whole series, characters\\' lives (I wasn\\'t aware of Snape\\'s until about a week ago), etc. In spite of all that, I\\'m still somehow loving this series. Again, after Deathly Hallows I hope I know whether it is my favorite series ever. This is the first Harry Potter book that I have read in a normal amount of time (all of them have previously taken me 1 day, a week, or two weeks to finish) so I feel like completing this in 4 days contributes to how much I loved this book (even though I obviously would have loved it just as much.) Again, as a reference point to future Savannah: you just sat and read this book for about 6 hours in 2 hour segments in your last 2 days of reading it. I don\\'t really have anything else to say. I just. Wow. Ugh this book still makes me cry, years later. I cannot believe how the book ends -- or what I know what will happen in the future. Re-read #??? completed 12/6/14 (1st re-read via audiobook):  Well. It\\'s so interesting to see how much my opinion has either stayed the same or changed with my re-read after so many years. The Half-Blood Prince was one of my favorites since the last time I read it (at least 5 years ago if not 10. Clearly I was not good at keeping track) and I think it\\'s safe to say that it\\'s still my favorite of the entire series. I love everything that happens with Harry\\'s knowledge and seeking of information about how Lord Voldemort is as well as the fact that the book still largely takes place at school (I still love book seven but the fact that Hogwarts is mostly missing is something that I really did miss from the book). It may be in part since I realized that I actually haven\\'t seen the movie in forever so the book was really in the forefront of my mind instead of the movie version of events... I also am not a huge fan of movie Ginny and she still feels very much like a secondary character in this book still but she\\'s starting to really have more of a presence. I tried to put movie Ginny out of my mind and it helped a bit (poor Bonnie) and the relationship between Harry and Ginny in the book is SOOOOOO much more natural than in the movies. Anyway. Love the information we get in this book. Still solidly one of my favorites -- no wait. My actual favorite -- of the series. Full review posted HERE on The Book Addict\\'s Guide 1/23/15: ** There WILL be spoilers for this book (and the final book) so if you haven\\'t read it yet, BEWARE. You\\'re gonna get spoiled! I felt a bit of pressure before starting HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. It\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve re-read all of the books but I always claimed this one as my favorite of the series. After realizing how much my opinion of ORDER OF THE PHOENIX had changed, I was totally unsure of how HBP would go. Right off the bat, though, I was still in love. I just love how this book really brings everything to the next level -- from the plot to the adventure, Quidditch to romances -- everything just gets bigger and better in HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. I think one of my favorite things about it is the introduction to Horcruxes. I just really love the layers that it adds to the plot and how it adds another sense of adventure for the characters. I also really, really love that we get to know more about the villain\\'s past. I LOVE when the reader gets to know more about the villain and his backstory. I think it adds so much to a book and even makes that villain a bit more human -- whether that\\'s by a little or a lot. We all know how amazing J.K. Rowling is at her world building in these books so I guess I should never be surprised but that really is one of my favorite things about the entire series. I really wasn\\'t big on many of the romances in this series. For me, Harry Potter was always more about action, adventure, friendship, learning, and well... magic. Movie Ginny kind of ruined book Ginny for me so I was really trying to give book Ginny another shot since I know where this story goes... I felt like she actually wasn\\'t hugely present in HALF-BLOOD PRINCE still so I didn\\'t feel like I had the opportunity to be bothered or charmed by her. She did make many appearances at the Slug Club parties and Quidditch matches, etc but for some reason I still felt like she wasn\\'t a very big character... I\\'m really interested to see how I feel about her in book seven because so far reading the books, I still don\\'t feel a lot! I do, of course, love the Ron and Hermione romance. You know I love best friendships turning into something more and this was a long time coming. It\\'s really interesting to see how this tension has slowly built and comes to its breaking point at the end of HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. As always, I love the layers upon layers of world building. From getting to know more about Voldemort to the different classes the students take to the different places they visit... I just love getting lost in this world and something about the writing just makes me feel like it\\'s a real place, just out of my reach. I always love learning more about magic and what the rules are and what the limitations are. The Felix Felicis chapter is still one of my favorites and the cave scene at the end still creeps me out a lot. Then of course we have Dumbledore\\'s death. I\\'m not sure why -- maybe I know the books/movies too well? -- but I never really feel shaken by the deaths in these books (except for probably Fred, oh god, how will I read that) so I really didn\\'t get too worked up over his death... But I think for Dumbledore, it doesn\\'t really feel like he\\'s gone, you know? His portrait is in the headmaster\\'s office and we know he sort of... appears to Harry in the final book too. It\\'s Dumbledore. He\\'s the greatest wizard of all time. He may be dead but only kind of? The great news is that HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE still stands as my favorite of the series so far! I was never able to place my love for the final book so it\\'ll be interesting to see where I come out on this re-read! Ranking after re-read of book #1: [1] // [6, 4, 5, 7, 3, 2] Ranking after re-read of book #2: [1, 2] // [6, 4, 5, 7, 3] Ranking after re-read of book #3: [3, 1, 2] // [6, 4, 5, 7] Ranking after re-read of book #4: [4, 3, 1, 2] // [6, 5, 7] Ranking after re-read of book #5: [4, 3, 1, 5, 2] // [6, 7] Ranking after re-read of book #6: [6, 4, 3, 1, 5, 2] // [7] Good book. I liked it much more than the fifth book I think. Harry starts to come into his own and scene is finally set for the finale. Seventh book here I come. With Harry\\'s occlumency lessons with Professor Snape a resounding failure, he begins lessons with Dumbledore instead. Together, they explore memories collected by Dumbledore in an attempt to better understand Lord Voldemort. Meanwhile, Harry has found an old textbook filled with the notes of the previous owner - known only as the Half-Blood Prince. The notes help Harry excel in his Potions class, but after the encounter with the evil book in The Chamber of Secrets, Hermione has some reservations about using such a powerful book. There was some interesting play with morality in this volume. Not to give too much away for the three people left on earth who haven\\'t read the series yet, but Harry has to cause harm to someone he loves for the greater good. It\\'s an extremely powerful scene that marks the tone for the rest of the series. Seriously, I was bawling. This book is the Empire Strikes Back of the series. This book........ It has broken me. I don\\'t think I will ever be the same. Dumbledore I NEED YOU! You just can\\'t be gone...... No No Noooo:( Snape and that little piece of shit Malfoy will pay with their lives. Even though I know that\\'s not what you would want. DUMBLEDORE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Holy big-sobbing mess, Batman. *sniffle* I liked it more than Harry Potter 4 and 5. Harry was so nice in this one. but didn\\'t have a great story like the first three books. Review to come. This one made me sad. But.... Hello? Its Harry Freaking Potter!! ***SPOILER ALERT!!! Harry continues to mature, his understanding of the world continues to grow in sophistication, and the battle between the good and evil forces grows ever more perilous. The plot moves forward toward the ultimate confrontation between Harry and his nemesis. Voldemort\\'s character grows ever darker. Harry looses a valuable ally. In between, he learns more about magic, shows up Hermione, and develops a romantic entanglement. The writing is crisp and moves along quickly. The minute I began to read the book, my heart couldn\\'t stop beating, my eyes couldn\\'t stop reading, and my hands couldn\\'t put the book down. Unfortunately, I saw the movie before reading the book. (yes I know, never judge the book by the movie) well, I might have to say, it\\'s true. You should read the book before watching the movie just because in the book it has more details and the movie will just make you cry and not understand the whole point. He fought, somebody dies, and everybody cries. But the book tells you so much more...You\\'ll just have to read it if you haven\\'t read it yet. Reading this again just reminds me how badly they screwed up the movie. first read jan 2015 second read 27/01/2017-01/02/2017 So I watch the movie before reading the book (Yes you may wonder why I do such horrible thing). The thing is I used to not like reading especially big book or series like Harry Potter !! I just read and finished Harry Potter last year. I decided to read it because of my bucket list. I must finish Harry Potter before going to college. And I did and I loved it. Everything is just magical. (This is not my first fantasy series/trilogy though). I literally inhaled this book the first time through. I enjoyed it much better the second time through, just this past summer. I swear I didn\\'t read the ending the first time through as this time it was like reading it for the first time. Finished reading this book in just half a day! Still my favourite Harry Potter book by far. It\\'s the perfect balance between action, information and down time. A true masterpiece in literature! Another great Harry Potter book! I felt really really awful when Dumbledore died. it was as if someone I knew in real life really did pass on. I\\'ve gotten attached to the old coot. I also felt a little bit of hopelessness. I thought all was lost when Dumbledore passed away. thank goodness for Harry... although he was a little helpless at first. this book gave me the strength to believe in Harry. the belief that he really could defeat the dark lord. This one was hard for me to get into and it started off really slow, but the ending was like BAM! The last hundred or so pages had me curled in a ball and holding my breath as I read. It was worth the slow start! I\\'m going to review these as a series since it\\'s been awhile since I read them. Just know that Deathly Hollows was by far my favorite. The series starts off slow and relatively innocent but really picks up the pace around book 3 - The Prisoner of Azkaban. The writing is spot-on, never lulling the reader into a detail-ridden coma, but instead begging to be read late into the night. These books are so well-written and enjoyable and perfect for re-reads. Really good. I loved it. I love all these books though... lol. eally neat to finally learn more about Professor Snape though.  liked that you find out how awesome he is at potions . he love stories took a turn  in this one too. It played the story well, and was so full of information i was dying to finish the book! This is my most favorite book of the whole HP series. This book was a roller coaster ride of emotions, drama, mystery and tragedy for me as a potterhead. For me, this is the best book of JK Rowling up to date. Oh hey, Ginny Weasley has an ACTUAL PERSONALITY. ** spoiler alert ** I loved this book as one of my favorite books. I really hate the part where Dumbledore dies though because its so sad. The fact about how the Horxrux wasn\\'t even real though and Dumbledore died for it is even more sad. I cried so hard in this book :( After the letdown of \\'Order of the Phoenix\\', I was happy to realize that I was really enjoying the writing and mystery of this edition detailing Year #6 at Hogwarts. Harry\\'s Spells class runs out of new \\'recipe\\' books, so an old book that was lying around in the closet. The book was previously owned by somebody named Prince. Prince added many notes to the brewing of the spells, and whenever Harry followed these additional instructions, his concoctions always succeeded. Who was this Half-Blood Prince? I had many theories, including Harry\\'s mother, but was wrong on all of them. She fooled me on this one and it was good choice what makes all the sense in the world once revealed. Very good. I liked this book all the way to the very end where things really started to fall apart for me. Dumbledore drinking all of that lagoon water which made him dipsy made no sense to me and seemed completely out of character. And for what? They didn\\'t find the key to destroying Voldermort. Only a clue to another person who is out for Voldermort with the initials R. A. B. Isn\\'t it a little late in the series to be introducing new mysteries and characters like this? Yet another Major character is killed off. I felt this was more for shock value than anything else and it all seemed so meaningless. And most disturbing to me... Harry quits school! What kind of message is this for children? A frustrating last couple of chapters. Stephen King says:\"The miracle of the Harry Potter series is that it keeps getting better. The genius of Ms. Rowling was her decision (probably never even seriously considered at the time) to follow Harry through his schooling. As a result, Harry\\'s fans have never left him behind. The question is whether Ms. Rowling will be bound to him for life, as Arthur Conan Doyle was bound to Sherlock Holmes.\" He recommended audiobook, too. I loved them all! Read \\'em twice! I...I can\\'t even begin to describe my thoughts on this installment. This book had the Hogwarts charm the earlier books had that was absolutely amazing. The characters have grown so much. They have all become wonderful people that i genuinely care about. Harry especially. You can really tell he grew in this book. He\\'s less arrogant and can control his temper somewhat. I can\\'t decide which character is my favorite though. All of them are awesome or are fun to hate. The ending killed me though. I am not okay. I am in awe of how Rowling created this magical world that never gets boring. I have seen all the movies but yet I was still shocked and hurt and happy every chapter. (The movie does not do the ending of the book justice except for the wands scene in the movie) Rowling really knows how to write. Every book gets more fascinating as you turn the pages. My favorite part was the scene that Harry learned about Voldemort\\'s past. They were so interesting. I cannot believe it is almost over. I don\\'t know how Harry Potter fans dealt with it. I\\'m not sure if I can get to the last book. I cannot believe I only have one more book left. Harry Potter fans had to deal with it longer than I have though. I get it now. I get the fuss. I can\\'t pick a favorite book from the series but this is up there. Wow Reread fueled by watching the movie and reading some quality fic. You\\'ve all heard of the book. If you haven\\'t read it yet & don\\'t want anything spoiled, don\\'t read beyond the cut. All I\\'ll say is that if you\\'ve read the first five books of course you\\'re going to get around to reading eventually and once you finish Half Blood Prince you\\'ll eagerly await the publication of the seventh book in the series. Grad school kept me from finishing it until now, so I\\'m sure I\\'m probably the only one who hasn\\'t read it yet. Anyway, Since I\\'ve gotten into writing these reviews for more general reasons & I\\'m really not anywhere near the biggest HP buff out there, I\\'m not going to get into debates about who R.A.B. is, whether Dumbledore is really dead, or what in the world Snape is up to. I\\'ve never known anyone to acurately predict such things, so while I don\\'t mind a little idle speculation, I\\'m not going to devote any serious energy to figuring out something that Rowling will inevitably explain much more creatively and entertainingly than I could. Two things that I\\'ve loved about the HP series that I think Half Blood Prince continued to do: Rowling has continued to fulfill her promise of making sure that the style of the books mature with Harry. Ayear older and wiser than the moody teenager in Order of the Phoenix, Harry\\'s realizes there are more important things than getting pissed off at the world. He\\'s still a 16-year-old boy, though, so it\\'s not surprising that he gets frustrated with Dumbledore for not telling him everything right away, but I\\'m glad to see that he\\'s calmed down a little bit. Even while dealing with more and more intricate plot details, or maybe because of that, Rowling still manages to craft a very great mystery, leading us one way, and in the end, showing us that it\\'s really something completely different. For example, with all the talk about werewolves and Draco\\'s mysterious disappearances and sickly appearance had me convinced that Draco had become a werewolf, which made me feel pretty stupid when the truth was revealed. I love that she\\'s still able to trick me after five books of getting used to her writing style. Two other things I liked about Half Blood Prince specifically: I love this whole Horcrux thing. It\\'s so satisfying to finally know how Voldemort can be defeated. As a reader I\\'ve been a little more satisfied about the ultimate mystery of the series, how to kill Voldemort, but at the same time I have to read the seventh book to find out if Harry is actually able to defeat him with this information. Harry Potter finally gets a girlfriend! Ginny is way cooler than Cho, and it\\'s good to see \"The Chosen One\" hooking up with someone as talented and clearly on his side. I was starting to feel like Rowling was forgetting about raging teenage hormones, so it was also nice to focus more on Ron and Hermione\\'s seemingly never-ending dance around getting romantically involved. Plus \"snogging\" is among the coolest British slang ever. I approve of the many excuses to use it in this book. Two things I was less than excited about in Half Blood Prince: Harry breaking up with Ginny at the end of the book. She\\'s tough; she can take it. Besides she\\'s already a target as Ron\\'s little sister, which we\\'ve already seen. Besides, they weren\\'t exactly hiding their relationship, even if took Harry forever to get around to snogging her. Someone such as Draco Malfoy could easily inform Voldemort of Ginny\\'s even dearer place in Harry\\'s heart, even if they have broken up. Harry isn\\'t returning to Hogwarts?!? Because of the way these books have been structured and the importance of Hogwarts for Voldemort makes it clear that Hogwarts will still figure in the seventh book. But Harry isn\\'t planning to be a student anymore? I\\'m just having trouble getting my head around this concept. As for Snape killing Dumbledore: \"I\\'m not touching that with a 20-foot pole.\" Since I\\'m so behind the times and I know everyone else has talked this book to death, I feel so unmotivated to get into it in detail on this. Being part of an uber-popular series also makes this book hard to review, so sorry for the lesser quality of this review. My full review is here on my personal website. I\\'ll post a few excerpts here, though: 5.0 out of 5.0 stars The very worst thing about this book is how Dumbledore died. I love that Draco couldn\\'t kill him, but for it to have been Snape was just heart-wrenching to me. The very best thing about this book is Draco Malfoy! ;-) What can I say, I\\'m a sucker for blond bad boys. He wasn\\'t able to kill Dumbledore and I don\\'t think it because he was scared. That whole scene, actually, was pretty intense for me. And Snape... Poor Severus, having to kill his only real friend. *cry* To review the book now is pretty pointless but I\\'m doing it regardless. Everyone knows what a phenomenal series Harry Potter is. This book was beyond expectations. For those who still have doubts about reading the series or continuing it: just do it. I\\'m surprised to find that Dumbledore dies. It was another great book. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was my favorite book in the series! 5/5 stars! Thanks to my beloved co-workers... they spoiled Dumbledore\\'s death for me! but it was still super sad! I read this one when it came out but didn\\'t remember any of it really. Except the big huge thing that happened in the book. Even if it\\'s fiction, it\\'s like dementors are surrounding me or something...like I\\'ll never feel happiness again. Rowling has amazing talent to evoke readers to be so immersed in the story to cry (like I did during the 5th book) and feel as if you\\'ll never be happy again (like with this one). I also feel like this book was a \"in-between\" book. It doesn\\'t feel like a whole book. There was no meeting with Voldemort at the end of the book and fighting him like the rest of the books. Most of the book was spent with many plots and questions and that all ended pretty swiftly in the last few chapters. That\\'s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Oh, JK... I think the Harry Potter series had escaped from your vision of it and was too big for you to control. The first time I got to Half-Blood Prince, my interest had waned quite a bit, so returning to it this summer I could only recall the broad strokes -- Slughorn, and Dumbledore\\'s betrayal, and the people behind it, and the fact that we learned a lot about Tom Riddle\\'s backstory. Thus, I went into it with a mostly open mind, though I mistrust a lot of Rowling\\'s attitude towards her own world. - I really liked how all the layers of corruption in the Ministry were revealed, and while it\\'s horrifying that the entire governmental system of this world is a giant miscarriage of justice, it did add depth to the story. But as with Order of the Phoenix, a lot of the narrative arcs and \"facts about magic\" implicitly support those prejudices. There\\'s a very condescending attitude towards people and creatures with different levels or kinds of magic, even from the \"good guys\" who are pro-Muggle.  once you know that Draco was ordered to kill Dumbledore  you can see his fingerprints all over the more sinister elements of the book and you can see how honestly terrified he is of the darkness he\\'s enacting, even as he keeps coming up with other plans. - I always love learning about Tom Riddle\\'s backstory, and that\\'s really what this book was about, and most of the drama and romance in the present day was filler to support this infodumping. Finding out where he went after Hogwarts and who he killed and why was really really cool! - But then Harry and Dumbledore talked about Merope Gaunt is just awful! I\\'m not defending her use of the love potion to coerce Tom Sr. to marry her, and I certainly don\\'t agree with them that he \"abandoned\" her once he was released from her magic. No, no, I\\'m talking about the conversation that goes: Merope refused to raise her wand even save her own life. \"She wouldn\\'t even stay alive for her son? She had a choice, didn\\'t she, not like my mother--\" ...She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother\\'s courage Excuse me, but she\\'s not the first witch to die in the world?? It\\'s not like it was a selfish plot to become homeless and die in childbirth just so she wouldn\\'t have to deal with a baby?? Ugh!, moving on... - I love the idea that the prophecy only had the impact it did because Voldemort believed so deeply in it that he acted on it, and then Harry responded in kind. I do not love the idea that all of the above worked because Harry is so ~pure of heart~ that he would want bloody vicious revenge even if he hadn\\'t heard the prophecy. First of all, logic fail. Second, in the literal next chapter he almost kills Draco Malfoy in the bathroom, lol, guess he was too purehearted not to. - Actually, most of the ideas about how ~love magic~ and wizarding bonds work, are both inconsistent and pretty disgusting. On a related note, Harry\\'s \"monster in his chest\" re: Ginny, is terrible writing.  I\\'m a little annoyed that three MAJOR plot points happen on the same night, namely 1. umbledore locates the cave with the locket Horcrux, 2. alfoy fixes the Vanishing Cabinet, 3. relawney reveals that Snape was the spy who passed on half of the prophecy . I understand why she does this from a storytelling perspective, because it forces Harry to choose which one of those revelations to pursue, but as they\\'re only tangentially related, it seems like lazy writing. I will end with some genuinely good things from the book - Anything that comes out of McGonagall\\'s mouth - \"There\\'s no need to call me sir, Professor\" - Aragog\\'s funeral I\\'ve always counted this book as one of my least favorites of the series (if not my least favorite), so I was surprised to find that I really, really enjoyed rereading it this time! There\\'s not an awful lot going on for most of the book...the memories and backstory of Voldemort are obviously the most important thing here. Harry\\'s obsession with Draco gets a little old, and there\\'s the whole Lavender and Won-Won catastrophe. But I really love the memory sections, and the Felix Felicis scenes are among my favorites in the series. And the end is done really well, from the cave to the very end, which always makes me cry. I love love love Harry Potter! This is tied for my favorite book (with DH). The ending is wonderful. It\\'s kind of a series closing as we knew it, you know, as peaceful and defeating voldemort at his opening task to conquer all. (Chamber of secrets, stone, etc.) This is the beginning of the end, when they start their horcrux hunt, and everything will be put to the test. I can see how you wouldn\\'t like this if you don\\'t love Harry Potter, but I absolutely LOVE harry potter, so this was just another outstanding novel by Rowling. This book was the first Harry Potter book that I read. Not because I didn\\'t like the movies before, but I never really understood why everyone liked to read back then. So when I started reading the half blood prince, I was pretty amazed with how I was thrown into the book, and how much I loved they way she wrote it. The Halfblood prince, is one of the best books I\\'ve ever read, it had everything a great book should have. I kept trying to guess who the halfblood prince was, and it was nice to get to know Voldemorts childhood. I also loved how much quidditch there was in this book. So of course I give this book the ultimate 5 stars. Rating: 3.5 out of 5 In my opinion, the weakest book of the series. Oh, it\\'s brilliantly written but also heartbreaking, that\\'s the right word. Though, I have a feeling that Harry will return to Hogwarts (or so I hope). I\\'m still kinda upset, though. SNAPE???? WHAT THE FRIGGIN\\' HECK. I mean it\\'s weird that he would be someone\\'s favorite, but I thought it was all play and pretense when he promised to be loyal to He-Who-Has-No-Nose Hmm, how to put my feelings into words. Since so many people have read the books, I tried to stay away from reading reviews on Goodreads, and I did (at least for this book). herefore... I didn\\'t believe Dumbledore actually died until my friend who was also listening to the book with me admitted that he really was truly dead (she\\'s already read the books once). \\'m so confused whether Snape is a good guy or a bad guy. umbledore was so sure he was good, I want to believe that Snape had a good reason for killing Dumbledore.  didn\\'t cry when Dumbledore died (partly because I didn\\'t think he was actually dead and partly because I felt kind of \"meh\" about Dumbledore all along) but I did tear up a little when the phoenix sang his lament.  love that Harry and Ginny got together afterall. nd Ron and Hermione... sigh, the tension between them and their actions/reactions because they like each other but don\\'t want to admit it makes me want to shake them! ostly just Ron though. ah, Lavender Brown... :P Notes: listened to the audiobook, some swearing, kissing, some deaths/torture/injuries One of the least entertaining but most profound Harry Potters. This is the book where it all begins to come together. While the first 4, maybe even 5 books felt as if they were stand alone this and the 7th bring everything together and make it one overarching story instead of several stand alone book. JK has probably one of the most incredible mind out our generation. Snape and Narcissi make an unbreakable vow that he will protect Draco and assist them on his \"mission\" which we don\\'t find out until the end what exactly that is. For a change of pace Dumbledore picks up Harry to take to the Burrow and in classic Dumbledore well meaning manipulation he uses Harry to persuade Slughorn, a former teacher of Tom Riddle, Harry\\'s parents and company to return to Hogwarts and teach potions (Snape has finally been moved to Defense Against the Dark Arts or Dada, if you will.) Hermione is at the Burrow already and the next day they receive their O.W.L results and a school supply list. At Diagone ally they see Draco entering a Dark Arts supplier, Borgin and Burkes and follow him under the invisibility cloak. Harry becomes sure Droco is a Death Eater. Harry was not going to take potions because he did not receive an outstanding, which he needed to carry on under Snape. However when he returns to school he discovers Snapes promotion and Slughorn will be teaching potions. e has to grab a second hand book that he discovers once belonged to the Half Blood Prince  we later learn that the Half Blood Prince was Snapes Mother, snape used the book and recorded all kinds of interesting and helpful spells and potions. or the first time revealing Snape\\'s true brilliance in magic Harry uses the half blood Prince\\'s notes in the potion book which help him to excel in potions making Hermione mad and Slughorn dote on him. Meanwhile Dumbledore is regularly meeting with harry to look into the pensive to see all of the memories of people who have had direct contact with Voldemort. here is one memory from Slughorn that has been tampered and Dumbledore asks Harry to retrieve the real memory, which he does after several false starts  his memory shows us explaining what Horcrux are to Riddle and riddles deep interest in them. umbledore explains to Harry in order for Voldemort to be killed all the Horcrux (where voldemort split his soul) must be destroyed. wo Horcrux (Riddles Diary and Marvel\\'s ring have already been destroyed. . Harry through this learns about Voldemort\\'s family and his path towards murder and obsession with gaining eternal life. Blah blah teenage relationship drama happens. Near the end of the year Harry and Dumbledore journey to a cave to retrieve a suspected horcrux, Slytherin\\'s locket. The locket is at the bottom of a basin and can only be reached by drinking the potion above it. Dumbledore with Harry\\'s help drink and and Dumbledore becomes very thirsty. When Harry get\\'s him water from the lake Voldemort\\'s Inferi surface and try to kill them. Dumbledore fights them off despite being weakened. hen they return to Hogwarts they find the Dark Mark has been placed over the astronomy tower. umbledore tells Harry to get snape, they hear a noise and Dumbledore freezes Harry under the invisibility cloak just as Draco disarms Dumbledore and threatens to kill him. hat follows is a vaguely amusing conversation between the two where redemption becomes evident and possible. eath Eaters that Draco helped get in arrive and encourage Draco to kill Dumbledore. nape comes in, Dumbledore pleads with him and Snape kills Dumbledore. ollowing is another minor battle. arry finds out the locket is not a real horcrux, it contains a note from someone named R.A.B and Harry announces he will spend next year not a Hogwarts but hunting down Voldemort. I LOVE the theme of redemption here. Draco while a snobby little brat still has goodness in him. I love Dumbledore\\'s responses to Draco\\'s arrogance. Harry starts to grow up and we are left with more questions than answers. THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!! Oooooh!!! Honestly I ended up watching all the movies before reading the books (ashamed :( ) but because if that I have been absolutly dying to read the Half Blood Prince. It\\'s my favorite HP movie, ergo my favorite book! I\\'m a bit of an odd one I guess, liking the 6th book over the 7th, but I can\\'t help it :) Draco\\'s in this book more. It seems to be about him and his struggles as well as Harry. I love that because it shows that he has things going on as well and that... I think it\\'s hard for him even being the little rich Slytherin. In the earlier books he was just a little--Draco I\\'m sorry D:-- shit. Ruder and meaner than in thr movies. If y\\'all haven\\'t figure it out by now.... I love Draco/Tom. He\\'s my favoriteist character&actor! J.K.Rowling is just fabulous, if you haven\\'t read the Harry Potter books... SHAME ON YOU! Go do it now! This is the one book in the series that I always think I like the least, only to reread it and discover that I love it just as much as the others. I also always find it remarkable how these three teenagers are immediately prepared to take on just immense responsibility. How Ron and Hermione just so readily agree to drop everything and go with Harry. I think throughout the series we see snippets of Ron and Hermione\\'s strength, Hermione specifically, but this is the point we realize that in their own ways they\\'re just as strong as Harry. One thing that did always bother me with this book is how anticlimactic the cavern scene always seemed to be.  suppose that could be explained due to Dumbledore\\'s death and the fighting at Hogwarts during his death, as well as the fact the \"Horcrux\" is actually a fake, but I\\'ve always just wanted a little more from that scene. ven the fighting sort of seemed anticlimactic as it is told second hand to the reader, but ah well. I do think this book and the final chapter is but a taste of the sadness that is to come in the final original series. Series as a whole: 4-5 stars. I read this when it first came out 8 years ago, but luckily for me, I forgot 99% of what happened so it was almost like reading it for the first time. nd the only reason I remembered who killed Dumbledore was because Sideshow Bob mentioned it in an episode of The Simpsons. I\\'m not worried, Harry, I\\'m with you. Hands down, the best line in the whole series. This might be one of my favorite in the septology. More into Voldemort\\'s past which is exciting and terrifying at the same time. Also leading more towards the end of the series and has great suspense. So, going into my re-read of Half-Blood Prince, I actually expected this to get bumped up to 5 stars. It\\'s not. It\\'s staying 4. For whatever reason, more than any other book in the series, I built this one up in my head as having been way better than I remembered it being. I thought the reveal of who the Prince was had more impact than it actually did, but really...it had about as much impact as in the movie. I will stand by the fact that the book version of Half-Blood Prince is much more fleshed out than the movie version, and in that sense is much better. I had forgotten just how hell-bent Harry is on finding Malfoy out and proving he\\'s up to something. What is interested about this book compared to others is the fact that he\\'s actually completely right. Or, mostly completely. And yet, everyone thinks he just hates Malfoy and is going a little overboard. More than any other book in the series, Harry is sort of right on with what he believes is going on, but even his closest friends just don\\'t believe him. They\\'ll indulge him by listening, but clearly aren\\'t buying into Harry\\'s theories. Anyway...I\\'ll get away from that for a bit. One of the bright points of this book, for me, was Harry and Ginny coming together. I forgot that part of the storyline (probably because it was pretty much absent from the book), and how they came together. It was sweet, and a nice respite for both Harry and the reader in the midst of very bad things clearly brewing in the world around them. I\\'m not going to say I hated re-reading this one, but I will say it was one of the bigger disappointments of the re-read for me. In my mind, I recollected more...happening?....than actually did. I think part of this is knowing the crucial role Snape plays in this book, and also knowing about the reveal in book 7. In my mind, I combined events from books 5 and 7 and thought more of them actually happened in book 6. So, basically, it\\'s all my fault this one was a disappointment. One more book to go! Another great Harry Potter book and it\\'s still going strong after six books in. This book is a little bit darker than the first five books, which I like. The ending is very sad and so good. It made me feel a lot of emotions for just being a book. I would recommend these series of books to anybody. After the previous installments, I remember this book felt a bit underwhelming on my first read--a prologue to the real action in Deathly Hallows. Now, however, I think this is actually an improvement over the previous entry on the series. After the lack of a solvable central mystery in Order of the Phoenix, I\\'m very happy to see that Half-Blood Prince is meticulously plotted again, which three more or less separate mysteries converging throughout the novel: the nature of Malfoy\\'s plans, the mystery of the Half-Blood Prince\\'s spellbook, and the flashbacks into Voldemort\\'s past as we begin to understand the key to his immortality and possible defeat. We also get to spend a lot of time with Dumbledore, which is great, especially on the third chapter, when he arrives at the Dursley\\'s house. I also really liked the character of Horace Slughorn, a somewhat morally grey dude who\\'s still the most decent person I\\'ve seen come out of Slytherin. To be honest, I do still think that from Goblet of Fire onwards all these novels could have done with some trimming. Just cutting out all the repetition meant to make sure the reader can\\'t forget anything would be helpful. Ah this book. I still remember being in COMPLETE DENIAL about Dumbledore\\'s death at the end of this book. I religiously followed dumbledoreisnotdead.com, and I am convinced to this day that J.K. Rowling was planning on having Dumbledore still be alive but when she saw that website said, \"JK (teehee), he\\'s going to really be dead.\" Actually, to be fair, after this reading, and now that I\\'m reading book 7 again, I do think she actually intended on him dying. But my 16-year-old heart just couldn\\'t take the fact that Dumbledore could really be dead. I enjoyed this book, but I feel like it doesn\\'t stand well on its own -- it\\'s all to set up book 7. We learned so much more about Dumbledore in this one, but then he gets taken away in the worst way possible. I loved the Half-Blooded prince on paper and I absolutely cannot believe who it turned out to be since I don\\'t like that character. 2015 Reading Challenge: A Book with Magic. It doesn\\'t matter how many times I read this series, I\\'ll always love it every single time. The book with the greatest potential and the greatest let down. Don\\'t get me wrong, the Harry Potter series (the first four at least) can be enchanting, engaging and a truly worthy read... ... BUT it\\'s not worth the hype. I could name HUNDREDS of books and a score of series that would be a better use of your time than HP but, sadly, did not receive the \"hype\" this series did. Until the last two, somewhat three, books were read, I was somewhat of a Potter nut. I gave the fourth book five stars for a reason, after all. But starting at the fifth book, the story begins to fall off track. The sixth book was downright disappointing, the fact that a FAN GIRL gets the hero annoyed me, the seventh book, had it\\'s moments, I admit but Rowling should be shot for that pathetic epilogue. I\\'ve seen better writing from ten year olds and I am not exaggerating. Over all, I would tell you to try the series out. It\\'s been a great gate-way book into other (more worthy) fantasy books for many, many people and HAS convinced many kids out there that reading can be fun! It\\'s one of the few series out there that I believe will have some historical value because of that fact. If you are looking for an astoundingly great read, however... ... look elsewhere. re-read in 2016. This is a great book. It\\'s amazing to see how she has set up so much in the previous books and brings some of it to light in this book. Author J.K. Rowling returns back to form in the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series. Although the darkness from the later novels is ever present, the magic and charm from the first books in the series returns to bring a nice balance to this novel. Like a lot of people, I\\'m sure, I was out last night at midnight picking up my copy of the eagerly anticipated Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I went to the grocery, anticipating not only no lines, but also that I could purchase other things I needed, and get home faster to begin reading. I\\'ve read each of the Harry Potter novels by J.K. Rowling in less than a day, but today, having finished the sixth installment, the feeling is somehow different. ::: Beyond the Order ::: The blurb on the inside of the book jacket gives the reader a clue that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is going to be somewhat different, focusing on the everyday at the wizarding school Hogwarts rather than events happening outside the school. As the story begins, Professor Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster at Hogwarts and Harry\\'s staunchest protector against the evil wizard Lord Voldemort, comes to fetch Harry at his aunt and uncle\\'s home during the summer holidays. Harry\\'s family, Muggles (non-wizards) all, display their usual fright at being confronted with anyone from the wizarding community. As Dumbledore escorts Harry to the Burrow, home of Harry\\'s best friend Ron\\'s family, for the rest of the summer, he lets Harry know that he will be giving him private lessons over the course of the school year. He also has a task for Harry; luring a new professor to Hogwarts, Professor Slughorn, who the reader assumes will take over the Defense Against the Dark Arts position that somehow ends up vacant every year. Of course, with Rowling, things are never as they initially seem. Dumbledore\\'s private lessons with Harry actually consist of delving into Lord Voldemort\\'s history. Slughorn, who seems to want to cultivate a small cult of students who will move on to bigger things, or have important connections, doesn\\'t actually become the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. And Harry\\'s ongoing battle against Voldemort takes several unexpected turns. ::: The New Harry ::: While Rowling\\'s twists in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince live up to her usual gift of surprise, including the source of the assistance that Harry gets from the Half-Blood Prince of the title, there are too many plot devices, sub-plots, and characters left hanging. Fred and George Weasley, usually so entertaining, appear at the beginning of the book and then get little more than a mention for the rest of the book. An engagement between Bill Weasley and the former Beauxbatons student Fleur Delacour seems almost pointless, and the \"intrigue\" regarding the depressed condition of the Auror Nymphadora Tonks is similarly introduced and then wrapped up a bit too tidily. Even Professor Slughorn seems to have little to do other than one plot point that fits in a bit too neatly with Dumbledore\\'s charge to Harry. Even more noticeable, the irritable teen of Order of the Phoenix has been replaced with an almost unbelievably mature Harry, who seems to have accepted the loss of his godfather much too stoicly for a 16-year-old boy. This is a new Harry, one who is nearly an adult. But it feels at time as if Rowling has lost touch with her character. The listing for the audio book includes Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince as part of the Romance genre, and while you expect that 16-year-olds have some raging hormones, at times, everything else takes a back seat to the \"who is snogging with whom\" game. Probably the biggest surprise to me was how much less dark and violent Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is compared to the previous two books. My five-year-old daughter has fallen in love with Harry Potter, and while I\\'ve let her read the first three books, the violence in Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix are too much, in my opinion, I probably would let her have this one. Rowling\\'s dedication of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is to her baby daughter, and the reader is left to wonder if perhaps her feelings about pregnancy lightened the mood a bit. The series, up until this point, had gotten progressively darker, and yet Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, even with the darkest wizard ever known back in full power, seems almost Pollyanna-ish at times. Still, for Harry Potter fans, it\\'s been a long wait, and at nearly 700 pages, it\\'s still worth the read. While too many plotlines are tied up a bit too neatly, it\\'s at least a bit refreshing to have had so many questions answered that have been left by the previous six books. No Harry Potter fan will be left unaffected by the ending, and once again, Rowling will leave fans clamoring for more, waiting for the last installment, which promises to be very different from the previous six books. This review previously published at Epinions: http://www.epinions.com/review/Book_H... This one might actually be able to challenenge Prisoner of Azkaban for favorite in the series. love love love it. Still remember my sister screaming from teh other room when she got to a certain pivotal part in the book. So well written. To say the truth.. till this day I view this book as a really long Prologue to Deathly Hallows. This is the book that set it all in action. for a whole year and half after it.. it set my head swirling trying to identify the rest of the Horcruxes.. and Identifying them I did =D (I was never as much proud of myself as I was by discerning about the locket B) *yup I\\'m brilliant*.. and Naguini and Harry himself. I couldn\\'t believe what happened to DD. I thought it might be a hoax.. but when I thought more about it.. I realized it isn\\'t. This is the book when Voldemort is at his most horrifying.. We get to know how he came to this life.. a sad story and you can\\'t but pity his mom. We get to know how his life was at the orphanage.. an uneasy child he was and a creepy one.. no wonder how his dislike for muggles who averted him and disliked him back came to be. We get to know how attractive teenager and powerful wizard he was.. and how he wasted it. Voldemort\\'s background doesn\\'t excuse his horrible ways and let us understand why he became the dark lord.. no it emphasizes how it\\'s our minds and our choices that set our course. Like Voldy, Harry\\'s parents were out of the picture even before he can picture them. Like Voldy, Harry lived as an orphan.. but even worse his \"family\" made him feel more orphaned than any orphanage can make a child feel. Like Voldy, Harry was a peculiar child with no friends. But unlike Voldy, Harry decided not to let all this erase his faith in Good and justify why he may act Bad. A better message a writer can send to the world can never be. I AM NOT OKAY. I used to rank these books but the reread has completely ruined any hope of that. How are these books so good???? Neither can live while the other survives. This is the prophecy that haunts Harry throughout his sixth year at Hogwarts. He now knows that he has no choice but to face Voldemort, and to do such he must find his weak spot. With Dumbledore\\'s asistance, Harry ventures into Voldemort\\'s past, and finds the secret to his destruction. The goings-on inside Hogwarts take center stage in this novel, with the students battling their way through classes, Quidditch tryouts, and love. Dramatic battles and Draco\\'s serious dilema lead to breath-taking,screaming, gasp-inducing moments that we cannot forgive Rowling for. Just to warn you, there will be tears. Hilarious in parts yet serious in others, Harry Potter 6 is not a disapointment. Despite the heartbreak, I loved every moment of it. Ah, my initial memories of these one are somewhat tarnished.  desperately waited for the new installment, waiting at the bookstore with friends, and when we finally received our copies, one of them flipped to the back and shrieked Snape kills Dumbledore! and it kind of let it down. I still love this book though, then and now, because we see all that has happened up until this point makes sense.  also desperately defended Snape, much to the disbelief of my friends.  believed there was something in the pleading, and in the argument Hagrid overheard, but it was still with a sinking heart that I read it, and I hoped with all my heart I\\'d be proven right.  sure was! On to the final book in this reread that I do periodically. Harry Potter is as much alive in my every day now as it was when I was waiting for books and movies; I have over 1600 facebook pages updating me with HP news every day after all! Severus ... please ... This book broke my soul into so many pieces, it would put Voldemort to shame. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before. Never before, in all my re-reads of Harry Potter, had I realized how AMAZING Dumbledore was. And not just that, but how much Harry relied on him. Dumbledore was \"The Only One He Ever Feared\", and honestly i can not believe my 13-year-old-self, i was such an idiot for not loving that man. AND DRACO MALFOY\\'S CHARACTER BUILDING Seeing self-confident, narcissistic Draco cry was shocking. And how he didn\\'t kill Dumbledore even when Voldemort threatened his life? BRILLIANT character progress! Book 7 here i come! (Don\\'t break my heart please) Great how JK Rowling explains about all of the misadventures that Harry Potter has. hat I did not expect was the death of Dumbledore. The concept of a magical world drew me into these books and I will stay with Harry Potter until the very end. I gotta say, this book surprised me. The first time I read Harry Potter, the standout books (to me) were the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows. The other books seemed to be more filling, a way to get from one point to the next. My first reread, I fell in love with Order of the Phoenix, and developed a grudging admiration for Prisoner of Azkaban. (By grudging admiration, I mean I rated it five stars instead of 4.5.) And this reread, Half-Blood Prince is the book that wowed me. Everything, from the teenage angst to the character-driven plot to the revelations at the end, seemed perfect to me. Perfectly plotted, perfectly placed. I loved learning about Voldemort, about how his past shaped his future. I think I mentioned this in my Chamber of Secrets review: the parallels between Voldemort and Harry are kind of astounding. It\\'s what they did with the tragedies in their lives that truly made them into who they are. Also, I liked the idea of the prophecy - how it had no power until Voldemort gave it power. That\\'s pretty cool. And I loved Harry\\'s time spent with Dumbledore, though I\\'ll admit Dumbledore\\'s constant secret-keeping and mysteriousness did get a little irksome at times. I understand he was doing it all for Harry\\'s benefit, I really do, but that was possibly my only qualm with this book. I also loved Harry and Ginny . (Margaret, don\\'t do it . don\\'t do it . GINNY WEASLEY IS A WONDERFUL CHARACTER FULL OF FIRE AND LIFE. SHE TOLD ROMILDA VANE THAT HARRY HAD A HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL TATTOO. THEIR FIRST KISS WAS IN FRONT OF AN ADORING CROWD, AFTER GINNY HAD WON THE HOUSE CUP BECAUSE HARRY HAD LANDED HIMSELF IN DETENTION. GINNY IS AWESOME AND AMAZING. How, how, how did she turn into the abysmal shadow of herself that was in the movies? Tying Harry\\'s shoes? Do you trust me? I FEEL PERSONALLY VICTIMIZED BECAUSE OF THE TAMING OF GINNY WEASLEY. Ahem. That is all.) Another aspect of this novel that hit me right in my feels was Draco Malfoy. It is here that his character transcends the petty, \"my father will hear about this,\" nemesis of Harry\\'s that he serves in the earlier books. It is here that Rowling illustrates the way he is treading water in a pool that grows deeper the more he kicks. The boy is in way over his head, and that is the saddest part - he is just a boy. Just sixteen. Already being threatened by Voldemort; already serving his Dark Lord. And it is here that Harry\\'s character matures towards his schoolboy rival. He begins to pity Draco at the end, begins to see that they aren\\'t so different after all. I read this book pretty quickly (as it\\'s 2:30 a.m. while I\\'m typing this review, I\\'m going to say I finished in two days) and, even though it was my third time, was completely absorbed in the reading. As such, I didn\\'t have many English-nerdy, bright analyses, but I did have a few comments. -Whatever happened to the other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers? Voldemort applied for the job, presumably, about 20-30ish years before Harry went to Hogwarts. So did 20-30 teachers all just quit after a year? Did any of them die (before Quirrel)? Forget Marauders - I want a DADA teachers series. Oooooooh, now there\\'s an idea! -Cormac McLaggan. That name. The more you say it/read it, the more grating it becomes. I low key spent the entire novel wanting to punch him in the face. -RON SAYS \"ER-MY-NEE.\" squeal. -Speaking of teenage angst, I kind of wonder whatever happened to Lavender. I despised her within the context of this narrative, of course, getting in the way of my OTP - but I think that she would have been a decent character when not affiliated with Ron. Does she die in the next book? Has J.K. Rowling released information on her future? I honestly can\\'t remember. Man, I hope she doesn\\'t die . -Fred and George are really awesome, and I\\'m so glad Mrs. Weasley can finally see that. I\\'m just refusing to think about what happens in the next novel. Nope. -Slughorn referred to Ron as Rupert. I see you, J.K. Rowling, you sly dog. I see you. And, as always, some of my favorite quotes: \"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly. Yes, sir. There\\'s no need to call me \"sir\" Professor. The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. SASSY HARRY IS MY FAVORITE HARRY Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure. Utter perfection within a single quote. The thing about growing up with Fred and George,\" said Ginny thoughtfully, \"is that you sort of start thinking anything\\'s possible if you\\'ve got enough nerve. LOVE GINNY. LOVE FRED AND GEORGE. LOVE THIS QUOTE. Ooooookay. It is time. MARGARET ALYSE\\'S HARRY POTTER REREAD CRY TALLY! Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone: 1 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: 0 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: 3 (!!!) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: 2 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: 2 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: 6 Yes, you read that correctly. I cried SIX FREAKING TIMES at this book. Possibly because I read it in two days. When Harry smelled the flowery smell from the Burrow in the Amortentia potion. Have I mentioned how much I love Harry and Ginny? The quote, \"It was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.\" This just . touched me on so many levels. And Harry was so dang awkward in response. It was adorable and I\\'m not ashamed to admit that I cried. When Dumbledore\\'s insisting on drinking the potion himself, and Harry is panicking. Maybe it\\'s because I knew what was coming, maybe this is a hidden gem of a scene that is often overlooked . but I felt that this scene really helped to solidify the relationship between Dumbledore and Harry. \"I am not afraid . I am with you.\" So many parallels . such a beautiful moment. Draco\\'s struggles when faced with Dumbledore. He\\'s just a kid, younger than I am (granted, only a year, but all the same). He\\'s so young, and being forced to kill someone - at the possible cost of his family! That is twisted and demented and wrong. Harry\\'s grief and shock. This dude has lost so much. So many people. And every time, he\\'s had to pick up, go on . he\\'s such a strong character, it\\'s frankly astounding. (Though it is interesting: Harry\\'s never been to a funeral before Dumbledore\\'s? Wow. I\\'ve been to seven, spoken at one. I\\'m not sure why this surprised me, but it did.) TOTAL CRY TALLY, AS OF HALF-BLOOD PRINCE: 14 Now, onto Deathly Hallows, which will probably rip my heart into little tiny shreds. Probably? Pretty much definitely. I don\\'t know how to rate this entry in the series. What did everyone else think of it? And why? re-read in prep for book 7 (7/29/07) Okay this was not bad butttttttt Harry is a very stereotypical boy when it comes to Ginny and I\\'m disappointed. More re-reading, and I\\'m almost full up with HPness. On the other hand, I think this is my new favorite of the last 3 books - more depth, the whole Harry-is-right-Malfoy-is-Up-to-Something plot, and more pieces I didn\\'t quite remember from previous readings. The entire funeral scene is stuck so hard and so visually in my head, I am always startled that all the things that happen in the book don\\'t happen in the movie. Half-Blood Prince is the best HP book, fight me. I did y\\'all a favor and rewrote page 596. Re-read: September 2015 The first 300 pages were slow and boring. Too much recap - get on with it. But the end was awesome, with a good Empire Strikes Back-esque cliff-hanger. There needed to be a scene of Harry and girlfriend Ginny interacting before they fell in love, but hey, it worked. My prediction after reading: In the next book, Harry will discover that the horocrux locket was taken by Regulus Black, left in 12 Grimmald Place, then taken by Mundungus and sold. Oh, and Bellatrix has another horocrux. ** spoiler alert ** I forgot how much I love this book. From sassy Harry to the dark themes. I love how final Harry\\'s childhood feels by the end of this book. He realizes now more than ever that he has to go on this important mission no matter what. I cannot wait to start the final book. Read July 2012 Re-read July 25-Aug 8 2013. This one is probably my favorite in the series, because the character become more than just cardboard cutouts; especially Dumbledore! Ron is as annoying and useless as ever. The part where Dumbledore... you know. Still as effecting as the first time I read it, my heart pounding, hoping for a miracle. Just re-reading it with the understanding of the hatred and revulsion on Snape\\'s face as he does it, it\\'s so moving. I don\\'t understand why people like Malfoy so much. Ok, yeah, he didn\\'t have the desire or the guts to kill Dumbledore, but if it weren\\'t for extraordinary good luck, he would have killed two other people. And he and his parents don\\'t necessarily like the consequences of being evil and befriending a soulless murderer; well gee, cry me a river. I don\\'t like the Malfoys, and I am annoyed that people find them so awesome when they ARE NOT. THEY ARE JERKS. Re-read Aug 2014 Reread this, this time with my 10 year old as he read it for the first time. I was struck with Rowlings ability to show things a bit at a time or not at all. From this book, you would not expect anything that happens in the 7th. That is amazing to me. There\\'s just so much MORE to the story and you think you will know how it goes and you don\\'t at all. There are some very subtle things through the first books and #5 that you can only notice after you\\'ve read #7, it\\'s a lot of fun to see that. I do love this book. Re-read Aug 2015. I told Josh I would buy him a butterscotch beer if he re-read the Harry Potter series with me over the summer break. He\\'s beat me to the finish, as he\\'s done with #7 as I\\'m finishing this one. It\\'s a great read, as usual, but I can\\'t understand why Dumbledore didn\\'t tell Harry he was dying and he asked Snape to kill him. Surely he realized what might happen when they came back to Hogwarts; even if not in that moment, sometime in the near future Dumbledore knew what Snape would do. Why, why didn\\'t he tell Harry. It\\'s completely irrelevant to the tasks Harry was given. It seems like he only didn\\'t tell him because PLOT, but it doesn\\'t do anything for the plot. It struck me as very annoying. Re-read Jul 08, 2017 Fun re-read, still sad. How can you possibly make a book about magic so boring? This should have been called Massive Plot Dumps with Dumbledore instead. This is probably my favorite ...... oh wait. That\\'s so hard to decide. I love this book though. This one and number 3 are my favorites to reread, probably because of all the teenage romance and because up until the climax, the pacing is a little more relaxed. I love the end of this one. She makes some daring moves that are always a pleasure to read. I bawled like a baby in the last pages. This was the most emotionally touching book of the series. I am not a huge Dumbledore fan but his death marks the end of an era! Also Snape - poor, poor Snape! Malfoys find out that anyone can be victims of the dark side, irrespective of blood status. Not feeling so good about it now, are you? Dear (sexist jerk) Ron, Ginny is not your property. Nor is Hermione. Both can do whatever they like in their lives. So please stop acting like an entitled prick. Is that clear? Yes? Thank you. Dear Tonks, get over it already! There are many fish in the sea. Well, that\\'s all. I just wish I hadn\\'t given the other books 5 stars because this definitely merits a higher rating. Second to least favorite of the 7, but still so good and that ENDING. I refuse to write reviews for these books because there is just too much epic awesomeness for me to do it justification. Just read it, damnit. The salve to the wound that is book 5 and by far my favorite. I am not a sci-fi person and so surprised by how invested I had become with these books. Year 6, 16-years-old, brings the drama and romance that I usually look for in a book. LOVE IT! Whoa, ok. No snark, all impressions. My impressions: -Called it again. But this time more :( -Cho was a ho, and so is Ginny? Wait--what? Where did this come from? -Horcruxes are reminding me of when Link has to collect the pendents to get the master sword and then you get taken to the dark world to get the seven crystals and it gets a lot less fun from there in Link to the Past. Will the next book be less fun? Probably. -Never trust a book that has handwritten instructions. Shoulda learned from that diary. -Why was Malfoy allowed back at Hogwarts at all this year? -She\\'s really gotten bored with Quidditch at this point, huh? -And the food and candy -I want a Pensieve. -Snape IS A BUNGHOLE. I was wrong to doubt my original assessment. Or was I? I have a feeling his story is far from over. A missing piece. Haven\\'t worked it out mentally. Well, one more to go. She shed the over detail long craze of books four and five, and got more to the point with this one. I expect more of the same for the last installment. Here I go... Again, I have been spellbound by Rowling\\'s writing style. I love how she follows the great writing traditions of other English greats. If you love fantasy and being enrapt in another world, then you will love this series. With Rowling\\'s wicked sense of humor and vivid narrative, Hogwarts and its occupants come alive and I found myself unable to put it down and thinking about it after I had. I just love getting lost in a story and Rowling makes it easy. I cried long after I finished this book. It was even more moving and captivating than the last one. This is definitely my favourite book in the series so far! Put three stars because only at the end the book started to have something action and for 80% of the book it was just dragging along with the usual. I think it was the slowest read from all potters for me. The ending of this one made me so freaking mad! *Ugggh* Just one of many rereads and yet I still pick up on new bits and pieces I missed or glossed over before. And book Ginny is the best. Those last chapters still hurt... all these years later and they still hurt... Once again, the dark side of this series is in full force here. But even with the terrifying stories of how Voldemort came to be and all the terrible things he did, there are the bits of teenage angst and relationship drama one would expect from sixteen year olds. This is also the first time there is something set up for the following book. At the end of the others its just assumed that school will resume as normal, and whatever happens will happen. This time around they aren\\'t going back to school, there is a wedding to attend, Harry has a vague plan for defeating Voldemort, and they need to find R.A.B. (The setup is rather nice!) At the end of the book, when Fleur announces that Bills scars will prove that he is brave and that she is beautiful enough for the both of them, and when Tonks begs Lupin to understand that she loves him regardless, and when Ginny says she never gave up on Harry and that she still won\\'t, it proves everything that Dumbledore has always said is true. Love overpowers Evil. I have reviewed the series as a whole,  here. I\\'m desperately trying to remember what happened in this book, but nothing really jumps out at me. So about average for the series. 4 STARS \"It is the middle of the summer, but there is an unseasonal mist pressing against the windowpanes. Harry Potter is waiting nervously in his bedroom at the Dursleys\\' house in Privet Drive for a visit from Professor Dumbledore himself. One of the last times he saw the Headmaster was in a fierce one-to-one duel with Lord Voldemort, and Harry can\\'t quite believe that Professor Dumbledore will actually appear at the Dursleys\\' of all places. Why is the Professor coming to visit him now? What is it that cannot wait until Harry returns to Hogwarts in a few weeks\\' time? Harry\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts has already got off to an unusual start, as the worlds of Muggle and magic start to intertwine...\" (From Amazon) The novels are all coming together and the suspense has me hooked to see how it all ends. I feel like my heart and soul have been ripped from my body. So many tears, and \"No, no no no no no!\" this book will rip your heart out. I loved it, it\\'s very well written, the characters well done, the story well told. It\\'s Harry freaking Potter. Just leave me to my tears now...as I prepare to get ready for the final book in the series. *sobs* And why can\\'t we have half stars? I\\'d put it at a 4.5 but, close enough! Few minor issues with the book but still thoroughly loved it! For the first time ever, I have loved Ginny. It was written just as well as the others, but I didn\\'t like it quite as much because, it being the 6th book out of 7, it started to reveal and solve the mystery/suspense rather than increase it...This, of course, is appropriate, but I just found it not quite as exciting - and also sad! (The series is drawing to a close!) Yoooo all the feels are back man. I forgot how addictive this series is. I can finally say that, Ron, Hermione and Harry are #SQUADGOALS Book Ginny is my new crush! This is my favorite HP book, because of how seamlessly Jo combined the worlds of magic, war, and teenagers. It is also the first book to ever make me cry. This will forever be my favorite Harry Potter book. Loved re-reading this book. he second time around I didn\\'t cry when Dumbledore died , but I did get really emotional when Mrs. Weasley was talking about Bill and how young men who are healthy don\\'t always stay that way. Serious heart string tugging was going on. I liked that Voldemort is a total sociopath and collects trophies, like in TV shows about serial killers. It made me imagine him having a map with lines going everywhere and pictures of Harry Potter all over his bedroom. I didn\\'t find Slughorn as annoying as I originally found him this second read through. Still obnoxious but also really smart and calculating. Can\\'t wait to read the last book but I don\\'t want HP book club to end! I was wrong. The Half-Blooded Prince is even darker than its predecessor. Everyone is finally growing up. Falling in love seems to be one of the characters purposes in this book. There\\'s a couple of love triangles in this one. Namely, Ron/Lavender/Hermione and Harry/Ginny/Dean. Jealousy is at strike for them and their love for each other is inevitable. Harry is in love with Ginny Weasley, Ron\\'s sister. Hermione loves Ron, even though he is with Lavender Brown, his snogging partner(Ha! Meanwhile, Dumbledore has a plan for Harry: Revisit Tom Riddle\\'s(Voldemort) memories. There they find Riddle\\'s darkest intentions, his childhood, and the reason why he became the man that he is now. That causes a new discovery: Horcruxes, which are pieces of soul in inanimate objects to ensure the person\\'s immortality(that\\'s what I understood, anyway). Voldemort has seven Horcruxes and they have to be destroyed. Also, Harry finds a book with the name tag: \"Half-blooded Prince\"(hence the title). The book helps Harry to pass Potions and develops an obsession with the book. Talking about obsession, Draco Malfoy is up to something, and Harry wants to figure out what is it. I\\'ll say it: He is Voldemort\\'s helper. Someone seems to regret it. This book has a lot of twists, unfortunately, it has been spoiled repeatedly. So much, that I don\\'t think it matters if I say it: Snape kills Dumbledore. There. I said it. End of review of the almost final book. I read somewhere that the last books of the Potter series lagged in comparison to the rest... That was a lie. If anything, I\\'m enjoying this series more and more. ut  WHY DID YOU KILL DUMBLEDORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  CRIED so HARD! o, no no no no... first Black now Dumbledore! hose next  Hagrid? .K. owling - did you invent this series just to break your fans\\' hearts? arry Potter without Dumbledore is like a night without the moon... you have the stars, but they\\'re just not enough.  cries ) So yes, I\\'m officially hooked. I\\'ve joined the bandwagon. Count me in. Some books instantly remind me of winter, this is one of them; but it is much more than the fact that I started reading this one next to a wood burning stove, covered in blankets. This book is cold. There is a tinge of bitterness and melancholy since the beginning, really; you can feel it while reading, some parts even make you feel sad. What happened at the end of Order of the Phoenix brought with it a promise of global change and it\\'s almost palpable now. There is no safe place anymore, Harry can trust very few people and even some of those he trusted to be friends still refuse to believe what he says about Voldemort, even though there could not be clearer evidence of his return. Nonetheless, I absolutely enjoyed this book from start to finish; I love how Rowling changed the whole pattern of the books from \"summer time; Hogwarts; problems; adventures\" to a real quest to defeat Voldemort. Differently from previous books, on this one nothing of particular impact happens to Harry before the new semester at Hogwarts begins. The only significant event that I can recall is Dumbledore using him as a human magnet to attract a new, supposedly, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. So we are introduced to Slughorn, which I liked from minute one. In my opinion, he is one of the most believable characters that Rowling ever created. Most of the wizards (not considering Harry, his friends and the majority of the Weasleys) display a certain stoic behavior; some of them, like professor McGonagall, for instance, don\\'t even express much emotion during the entire series. Slughorn, on the other hand, is a Russian roulette of conflicting emotions since his introduction. He feels proud of most of his acquaintances, ashamed of some, afraid of others. He feels attracted to the opportunity of being a teacher which would allow him to meet even more talented people, but afraid of what impact the exposure as a teacher would make in his life now that the world of wizards is being set upside down. Well, after this events, Harry is sent to the Weasleys\\', where nothing really meaningful happens. Then we have the customary travel to Hogwarts, where some enmities are reinforced, we might say. I must say that the atmosphere at school is utterly different from any of the other books. Some students didn\\'t even return to school, so afraid they were, which I don\\'t quite remember happening before, even when the Chamber of Secrets had been reopened on book two. As soon as the semester starts, Dumbledore starts inviting Harry to private conversations at his office, so we start to realize what this book is really about: send normal school affairs to the dumps, let\\'s investigate Voldemort\\'s past so we might come up with some way to defeat him. I found it great how Rowling added rebellious teenager behavior to back up Harry not caring much about school anymore, focusing on his new found mission. It added a much more believable sense to the character and to the whole story itself. Anyway, during the whole book we get to know, through collected memories of people who interacted with Voldemort during some points of his existence, a lot of unimaginable and priceless information which helps us understand what drove him to become what he is now: a monster. Setting Harry\\'s mission apart for an instant, I would like to mention how fun some parts of this book were, due to the tinge of \"sex, drugs, and rock\\'n\\'roll\" that Rowling displayed. There are constant love conflicts, hormones are exploding everywhere; even Hermione, which I could never guess cared much about people, was found crying in the corners, feeling alone and betrayed. Again, giving young wizards a little bit of \"muggle\" adolescence hell was very well done in the sense that it makes the story much more believable. As the story goes on, Dumbledore and Harry get closer and closer to uncovering Voldemort\\'s deepest secret, which leads them to go outside Hogwarts in search of evidence. Unfortunately, the results of their little adventure are disastrous. Getting advantage over Dumbledore\\'s momentary absence from Hogwarts, the dark forces find their way into the castle and things get really bad. Rowling is not afraid anymore, so the signs of her advanced \"George R. R. Martin syndrome\" are firmly displayed, which makes me take a star out of this book. The ending is bitter and sad, setting a clear path to what we can expect on the final book. Interesting quotes that I didn\\'t include in the review: It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right. Re-Read Number thirty-something - July 13th 2014. My second favorite of the Potter books, I\\'ve read this one about a dozen times. It\\'s always nice to curl up with a favorite book, even if the Malfoy plot one drives me nuts. Definitely one of the darkest of the books, this was truly a heartbreaker, I adored finding out more about the Malfoy\\'s and their involvement with Voldemort and Snape! oh Snape! awesommmmmenesssssss of awesommmmeneeeees Old friend Dumbledore why have you left meeee??? My favorite book from the series, mostly because it makes a little bit clearer who is going to end up with Hermione, and I was betting on the right one, so I think I was happy I got it right the whole time. And so lies the book that set forth a thousand adults\\' tears. So great is its prominence that when I emerged for dinner, very subdued, my family joined me in mourning after I told them I\\'d just finished The Half-Blood Prince. God, Jo. Why don\\'t you don\\'t you snap a broomstick across your knee and stab me in the heart with it? I\\'m sure it\\'ll be much less painful. Re-read June 2014. Oh my gosh!!! I can\\'t get enough. Must. have. seventh. book. NOW! (Full review to come.) This book broke my heart!! Dumbledore died.. wtf CAUTION: SPOILERS I actually can\\'t believe I\\'m on the last book already. I was always intimidated by the size of this series (and the size of the books in it), but it has flown by! So fast in fact that I don\\'t want it to end. I am in awe at how much this series has gotten under my skin! I\\'ve tried to read other things in between, instead of just binge reading, but I\\'ve found that I have trouble getting into anything else because all I can think about is continuing the series. And I know I\\'m going to have a book hangover from this series! It\\'s definitely special, and it\\'s going to be hard to read something that compares after this! I have to say I was kind of underwhelmed with the reveal of Snape being the Prince. I mean, it made sense after Hermione explained it, but there wasn\\'t really a big revelation there. It was just kind of like, Oh, I\\'m the Half Blood Prince...and then was barely mentioned again even though the book is named after him and the Prince\\'s book was a major part of the whole story. Also DUMBLEDORE OMG. I had trouble believing it at first, which is ridiculous - I remember his death very clearly in the movie, so I *knew* he was dead but even still, it didn\\'t seem real! I still can\\'t get over it. I did eventually start crying when they were all talking about it, and again at his funeral. I CANNOT DEAL. *sobs* FINALLY, Harry and Ginny get together! I didn\\'t realize how late in the series it happened. I kept waiting for it! Also, I kinda wanted to bash Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s heads together. They clearly have the hots for each other! Something I absolutely love about this series is that there is never a love triangle between Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Harry and Hermione are never more than just best friends. It\\'s so rare to see platonic love in stories, and I wish there was more of it! Boys and girls CAN just be friends, people. I love that Harry and Hermione prove it. And it\\'s absolutely beautiful! They are as close as brother and sister and I love it so much! I think their friendship is one of my favorites in fiction. I want a platonic friendship as deep as they have. Favorite quotes And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure. This review was originally posted on Novel Heartbeat. To see a breakdown of my assessment, please visit the full review here. Whether adult or child! What a great fun read! 1st read: 2005 2nd read: 2007 3rd read: 2014 Yes yes yes I\\'ve only just now finished this... GET OFF MY BACK lol I don\\'t know why it took me so long. I have mental problems. But OMG I think this is my new favorite Harry Potter book! I loved learning everything about Voldemort\\'s background and I just thought this one was so so good. I mean they are all amazing. Again, I don\\'t know my problem... Anyway I listened to the audiobook for this one because Jim Dale is a freaking amaaaazing narrator. It was so much fun listening to this. I love love loved it. These books are just so magical and I\\'m so glad I finally experienced this one. Also... the movie now seems so shitty in comparison lol. They changed too much and I just... I mean I thought I really liked that movie, but now I just think about how much it failed. *SPOILER ALERT* in case I\\'m not the only weirdo who hasn\\'t finished this series. but my biggest problem was that in the movie, Dumbledor didn\\'t \"petrificus totalus\" Harry... in the movie he was just hanging out underneath them... and that\\'s so NOT Harry! Harry would never just stand there and not intervene. They should have had Dumbledor petrify him. That makes so much more sense! And he still could have gone after Snape that way because the second Dumbledor died the curse was broken! So.... I just don\\'t understand why they changed that in the movie?! It\\'s so out of character!!! Also I\\'m mad they changed Harry and Ginny\\'s first kiss and get together stuff. It was not as good in the movie at all. They just changed silly things that I don\\'t get. Although... I will admit that I loved the portion of the movie when Harry had taken the felix felices. That was so funny! Lol I enjoyed that part of the movie a lot. So I didn\\'t mind the changes they made there I guess. But still. The book was SO much better. Of course. Because it always is lol. Thankfully, this book was much better than its predecessor and was probably the best in the series so far. It was nice to be at Hogwarts but not constantly covering the same ground as in previous books. The pace was steady and it moved along well. I\\'m looking forward to the next one. We were not prepared for this book. This book is the darkest so far of the series. Harry begins secret lessons with Dumbledore in order to find a way to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Highlights include awkward teen romance, The Slug-Club, and a very suspicious Draco Malfoy. Best moment has to be: \"There\\'s no need to call me \"sir\", Professor\". Highly recommend. My goodness, this is a great book. The depth of character development is amazing. Although the book is substantially long, it doesn\\'t feel so; it reads quickly. By the end of this book I am always feeling as if I\\'ve been on a roller coaster ride and I\\'m always in tears. Rowling amazes me with her ability to choose the exact right word for every situation. Her writing is exemplary. This last reading was probably around the tenth time I\\'ve read this and it gets better every time. My favorite book of the series (we\\'ll see if Deathly Hallows can top it). Enjoyed every second! I don\\'t know if I have cried so much reading a book. I have one more book but don\\'t know if I want to read it yet because I really like being in this world and don\\'t want it to end. That was the saddest ending among the books so far. Even though I knew what was going to happen from having watched the movies, the book has ten-times the impact of that certain wizard\\'s death. It was devastating, really. The Half-blood Prince has absolutely knocked off The Goblet of Fire from my top favorite Harry Potter book because it was certainly the most brilliant of them all. And that\\'s really something since every one of them were magnificent. The romances. Gosh, Harry and Ginny were so adorable! I couldn\\'t keep the goofy grin off my face. The kiss after Gryffindor won the House Cup! Ron and Hermoine. Tonks and Lupin. Even Bill and Fleur. Fleur ceratinly won me over as she had Mrs. Weasley with that \"I\\'m good-looking enough for both of us\" bit. But of course, the most important part of the book, Harry learning of Voldemort\\'s past. The Horcruxes. And how deep the bond Dumbledore and Harry had developed throughout the series. How Dumbledore saw Harry as an equal and how much he trusted Harry. The \"I\\'m not worried. I am with you.\" was quite moving. Draco Malfoy. Hmm. I still want to believe there\\'s still hope for this boy. I still don\\'t like him but he\\'s as much as a victim here than anything else. Snape, on the other hand, I never liked him really. BUT I know he\\'s really not a villain. I think he\\'s working on Dumbledore\\'s side as much as Harry was... because I\\'ve seen the movie. But I dunno, The Half-Blood Prince was the last movie I\\'ve seen yet. That makes me excited on reading the last book (LAST?! Whaaa?) because I have no clue at all what was going to happen. Norwegian audiobook. So I did like this one more than the previous, but I still felt there were quite a few holes. My first problem with this book is Dumbledore. Am I the only one who didn\\'t like him? I actually did like him in the movies, but in the books he is more annoying. I feel like he is just absent in the movies so it\\'s hard to dislike him, but in the books he is actively avoiding people and being secretive about it. I feel like all the books thus far have ended with him saying something to the effect of \"I have underestimated you Harry and it has lead you to grave dangers. I must not make that mistake again, from now on I must be upfront with you and trust that you are strong enough to deal with the truth.\" And then the next book he runs around being secretive again. This book is no exception. He even starts giving Harry lessons to make it seem like he is sharing information, though in the end it takes him almost the entire school year to tell him one thing. Also, why is it so necessary for Harry to get this memory from the other professor if Dumbledore already know what Voldemort had done and has already started destroying the horcruxes? The memory actually doesn\\'t confirm anything at all. Another thing, if Dumbledore knew what Malfoys was doing the whole year why didn\\'t he do something earlier? Why does he wait until the actual confrontation to say \"we can protect you and your family\". Wouldn\\'t it have been more likely to help him if the intervention was earlier, when he was less involved with the death eaters? Seems like he never really had any concern for Malfoy, which I don\\'t disagree with, but don\\'t come around and the last second and pretend you cared all along. And then lastly, a point about his beginning scene. I think the beginning when Dumbledore goes to Harry\\'s house is supposed to be funny, but really it was just rude. It reminded me a lot of that article where they explain rape as if you are offering someone tea. You can\\'t force your tea on people. It is perfectly fine to not drink the tea, even if it is offered to you. It\\'s also fine to offer tea. But if people don\\'t want to drink it, it is not okay to pour it down their throats. Anyway, onwards. I thought this book was pretty good. I thought that this book was much like the previous where there was not so much action, but this one did work on the development of the characters more. I think that overall all the characters got a bit more depth to them. Ginny, possibly the most. Snape, for the worse. The story had a few parts that were a little unclear. The cave being the largest one. It\\'s a bit unclear why and how Dumbledore is able to guess how exactly everything is supposed to be accomplished. He says that magic leaves traces, but I\\'m not sure how that leads him to the realization that drinking it is the only way. Another part is the entire thing surrounding Snape. All of the questions Beatrix asks him in the beginning are super valid questions which he does not offer good answers to. Also, with all these ways of getting into people minds and watching their memories and truth serums, why can neither Voldemort nor Dumbledore utilize these with Snape? I can see the good side having some reservations about using such tactics, but I feel like Voldemort would not. And what about the unbreakable oath thing? Why would Voldemort not have every death eater doing that? Also, why was Dumbledore so secretive about why Snape switched sides. Why did everyone just have to trust Snape on his word? Voldemort\\'s wrath seems much more deadly and even his people openly questioned that decision. Overall, an okay story to read but as the series continues the plot holes are stretched larger. I still remember the day my bff spoiled the ending of this book for me in class. He wasn\\'t my bff for about a month. No matter how many times I read this year in particular, it always makes me cry. It is SO suspenseful that it keeps me on the edge of my seat. Finally Harry gets over the angst of his 5th year, and the annoyance fades from our relationship. I adore this book, the plot thickens, the characters develop, and Rowling writes beautifully as ever. Still a great book, even the third or fourth time through. This remains my favorite for so many reasons. For one, it\\'s very much a calm-before-the-storm sort of book. There is so much rich backstory given that add layers to our villain. And Dumbledore, my God, I enjoy seeing so much of him here. He is deeply wise and emotionally intelligent, a kind mentor and merciful enemy. I love how apparent it is that the secondary and even very minor characters have rich, complex lives outside of what is going on with Harry. Remus and Tonks give me the feels every time. And Ginny is clearly a brash, passionate force who never gets quite enough page time for my liking. I also found on this read through, a special appreciation of Molly Weasley, Super Mom. This is my favorite book in the series. It contains mystery, tragedy and sacrifice...it pulled on my emotions much more than any other book in the series (which I still love anyway). SPOILER WARNING (seriously, you should have read these books by now, but just in case, don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.) Aaargh this book. I want to love it so much, such a step up from OOTP but man that friggin ending. I hate it and I love it, but the bad vibes kind of overrule. I loved Dumbledore\\'s funeral, a very nice farewell to such a great character but I hate how he died. But most of all I hate that stupid \"noble\" break up Harry does with Ginny. Seriously? We\\'ve been waiting for those two to get together since forever, you give us a measly couple of chapters near the end of the book with hardly anything of it happening on page and then you just end it. And for what? This stupid shit about \"I have to let you go to protect you\". Bull-shit! Are you seriously telling me that someone like Lord Voldemort won\\'t be able to figure out how much Ginny means to him because he breaks it off with her for no reason whatsoever at the funeral? Oh and Ron and Hermione can come along on his grand adventure but who cares what happens to them, right? It is just poor writing which sticks out like a sore thumb in a series that is otherwise for the most part so well written and I can\\'t deal with this right now because I\\'m grieving for Dumbledore, damn it! I\\'ve become more lenient over the years and upped it from three stars to four, but you cannot expect to do stuff like that and get full marks. Not going to happen. Rowling did a lot of things right with this series, the romance however, isn\\'t one of them. Why is this in the \"Chick-lit\" list??????? I just loved it. That\\'s all I can say. It\\'s easy to understand and the characters... just wow. I\\'ve read this book like five times but: still sobbing. I am re-reading the Harry Potter books as part of a group exercise some friends and I are doing. We each chose a book from the series and will go through and write in the margins sharing thoughts, etc. throughout. I chose HBP because it\\'s my favorite book in the series. This is the book that took the series in a completely different direction. It introduced the idea of Horcruxes, made Snape one of the most debated characters in history and rocketed along with lots of humor, fun and a touch of romance as well. Perfection. Re-reading it reminded me why I love the book so much and I fell back into love with all of the characters. The descriptions are great, the humor spot-on and the characterization are what make the HP series shine as well as Rowlings incredible world building. HBP is everything you could want in an HP book and definitely over-delivers. Love it! First time i read The Half-Blood Prince: Nooooooooooooo, DUMBLEEEDOOOOREEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! (Die Snape, you mother*****) Third time I read it: Nooooooooooooo, DUMBLEEEDOOOOREEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! (Snape, I\\'m still not over it..) Finished reading this with Angie today. I will forever treasure the memory of Angie bolting upright as if she was going to the rescue of one of the characters during one of our reading sessions. I can\\'t wait to see what she thinks after the last book. Well, like I remembered, this book sure is about the inevitable march toward doom. Rowling can still make lots of apparently disparate details suddenly come together in some excellent plot, and I\\'m a huge sucker for all the Tom Riddle backstory. And I noticed lots more details this time through. But reading the end bits at bedtime was pretty miserable-making. Aaaand, now I\\'m ready for HP7. I think. I re-read this because Three Cups of Tea was making me cry too much. What was I thinking, this makes me cry too. Dammit. My significant other read this one before me, so we were discussing parts of the book as I read it. During the course of these discussions, we have renamed the book, \"Harry Potter and the Year that Nothing Much Happens...until the END!\" Don\\'t get me wrong, this latest installment in the Harry Potter series is still a well written and engaging novel. It\\'s just that the story does not move along with the same energy as most of the earlier novels. The characters are still well developed and the history that we are presented with in this volume is very interesting as well. I just feel that I could have done with a lot less snogging and lot more actual events. I\\'m not going to ruin any of the twists in this book by going into too much detail, but suffice it to say that I did feel that this was a decent book, it just left me feeling a bit cheated and wanting for a bit more out of it. Oh well, not everything can be a home-run! yayyy. It only took me a week to read this book-it was short enough to carry around in my purse, so it got read about a billion times faster than the last couple. The \"emotional work\" that it does is great--suck it, Lavender Brown. The flashback structure is pretty decent. The Draco dilemma is about as good as it could be. The thrilling finale kind of comes as a surprise--and of all the books, this is the one that knowing the plot arc sort of ruined for me--I kept wondering when/if things were going to happen. Finally: For the record, I liked when Tonks was like \"Lupin! I love you!\" and Mr. Weasley was like \"Young and whole men don\\'t always stay young and whole forever.\" Sniffle. This was my favorite of the series... until I read the Deathly Hallows. I knew it was coming. I knew perfectly well and was prepared. But... it still stung... and it hurt a lot. BRB STILL CRYING Not as good as the last few books, but hey, nobody\\'s perfect. I think the issue here is that Rowling had to make sure she set up everything she needed for the grand finale in Book 7, and that threw the flow off for this book as a stand alone work. So I will reserve final judgment until after I read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. picked this up again as a comfort-read. trying to resist rereading the last book before the movie comes out because i know it\\'ll just make me annoyed with the movie. I would mark this as definitely the weakest of the Harry Potter books: Harry is much less likeable, his friends are at each others\\' throats the whole time; I was disappointed. It ends with a very smashing climax that makes it worthwhile, but I didn\\'t like most of the rest of it. J.K. Rowling does a lot of things well: high-school romance is not one of them, in my opinion, so this book where that is the focus just didn\\'t do much for me. ** spoiler alert ** I don\\'t really know what I think of the beginning, since the first two (clearly important) scenes are done outside Harry\\'s frame of reference. The whole point of the books has been that we\\'re in limited 3rd person POV - we find things out when Harry does. That\\'s been the clearly established rule for 5 books, I don\\'t understand why we\\'re changing it in the 6th. Obviously the point of being an author is that you make the rules, but once you\\'ve made your own rules you\\'re supposed to abide by them until you\\'ve also created an exception. That can be done more easily with substantive rules - you can have vampires wander around in direct sunlight eating garlic for all I care, if you say why you\\'re doing it. But a style rule that\\'s been clearly established isn\\'t supposed to be broken, unless you need information that CAN\\'T be conveyed any other way, and I don\\'t see why she couldn\\'t have conveyed the information in those scenes later in the book in the usual way. Okay, yes, it\\'s clearly important that we know about the Unbreakable Vow, but Harry found out about it anyway, so I\\'m not sure why we had to know about it when we did. The point could have been to introduce Narcissa and use Bellatrix again, but I\\'m not sure why we care. Or I guess it could have been that we suspect Snape, which would definitely be fun and games, but I\\'m suspicious of that clearly planted suspicion. My best guess is that we need to know not only THAT Snape made the Unbreakable Vow, but WHAT he vowed to do, and that must have been the most convenient way to do it. Also, I would like to veto love triangles. I know, I know - we have a bunch of 16 year olds of the two genders in constant close quarters, it would be more shocking if we DIDN\\'T have triangles. But it\\'s woeful to have to read it for a million billion pages. And Ron really can be a spectacular McAsshat when he wants to. (Lavender? Really? I have nothing against her, but really?) Although I worry about where she\\'s going with Ron and Hermione - they FIGHT. A LOT. And I don\\'t think that would change that much, no matter what happens...it hasn\\'t been the \"bickering of unspoken passion\" all this time. I think Ron started the snarking of move around Year 4, but Hermione has been thoroughly...Hermione until this year. Also, I kind of like her with Viktor Krum, because it was FUNNY. Although I am surprisingly myself by being a supporter of Harry-Ginny. I heart Ginny and I think she would work well with him. I mean, if it goes bad it will go VERY VERY BAD, as Harry himself as pointed out, but maybe it won\\'t go bad. Maybe there will be ONE THING in this ENTIRE SERIES that doesn\\'t end up going bad. ....Or she could be the one who dies at the end of book 7 WAH VETO. One disadvantage of being a Johnny (jill?) come lately is that I knew that Dumbledore died, just like I knew that Sirius died, but I managed to block that out with the supreme conviction of someone who believes that the bad ending will have worked itself out by the time she gets there. Unfortunately, it did not, and I am deprived of Dumbledore as I was deprived of Sirius, and yea verily I cried. I cried harder for Sirius than for Dumbledore, though I\\'m not sure why - probably because why Dumbledore\\'s death wasn\\'t a shock, how it happened was, and I was too busy screaming \"WHAT THE F!\" at the book to really be emotionally wracked. I had to go back and read it twice just to make sure I really understood what had just happened, because it seemed like there was just no way. So the end.....W. T. EEEEEEFFFFFFFF. I mean, what WAS that? Was it an Imperious Curse? Was it the consequences of the Unbreakable Vow? Or have Ron and Harry been right all this time? And it\\'s so utterly bizarre because earlier in the book I\\'d been thinking about how even though Snape doesn\\'t always like it, in the end he does usually seem to do what\\'s right, like when he made Lupin the serum or when he tried to teach Harry Occlumency-whatever, even though he doesn\\'t like it, and that was what had me convinced that Dumbledore was right in trusting him. And I\\'d thought that maybe if Harry just sucked it up and apologized to Snape and actually tried being polite it might help - like if he\\'d had sorry for his accidental disemboweling of Malfoy. I mean, yes, Malfoy was trying to use the Cruciatus on him, but I\\'d been thinking if Harry just manned up and said to Snape, \"Professor, I\\'m sorry I did that,\" without making excuses, that might make a different. But then after all of that it turns out that HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS HOWARD CHRIST ON A POGO STICK SNAPE BETRAYED THE POTTERS???? and I seriously rethought that idea. And then...and then after ALL of that, has he really been still working for Voldemort this ENTIRE TIME? I mean, I\\'d wondered if everyone circling you for all those years going Dumbledore trusts you but we don\\'t and we just want to make that VERY VERY CLEAR could eventually crack you, and then--wha--wha--what? And Dumbledore DIED FOR A FAKE HORCRUX AND WHO THE FUDGE IS R.A.B.? My brain has just waved a tiny white flag and crawled into the corner to cry. Dear J.K. Rowling: please cease and desist phunking with my heart. Book 6: The prologue to Book 7 Unfortunately, this book did not stand up when read directly after Book 5. Where the Order of the Phoenix dove deeply into scene descriptions, superfluous dialogue, and Harry\\'s interiority, this book steps so far back from Harry\\'s feelings that it could be a story from any character\\'s perspective. The plot, while still being better and more cohesive than some other published novels, was very simple for a Harry Potter book. I would equate the Half-Blood Prince with the complexity of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, only a little more boring because of an utter lack of new and interesting ideas (really, mentioning inferi a million times does not significantly increase the worldbuilding...). This book is the Sorcerer\\'s Stone for older readers. I\\'m looking forward to reading the next book, where stuff actually happens again. ** spoiler alert ** D totally got what he deserved. well written, but i don\\'t like any of the characters. Reread For the full review, please visit Thoughts and Pens Finally, the second to the last installment of the boy wizard\\'s amazing story. I\\'ve read this book ages ago but I can\\'t stop re-reading it especially these fast few months. I am terribly missing Harry and the gang. You must probably know by now (if you\\'ve read my past HP book reviews) that I intend to finish reviewing all the Harry Potter series because I owe him big time. Anyway, this is the second to the last HP that I\\'m going to review and I\\'m definitely moving read another series. (Watch out for that one) To start with, the Half-Blood Prince currently holds the number 4 spot of my favorite Harry Potter sequels with Prisoner of Azkaban holding the top spot. I have mixed emotions about it, not in a negative way though. I don\\'t know whether I\\'d be happy with it or be heartbroken when JK finished one of my favorite characters. That\\'s a spoiler, I know, but it\\'s necessary to be able to convey my review for this book. Going into the specifics, there are a lot of things I like about HBP. Number one is that JK Rowling didn\\'t fail to give us another jaw-dropping twist and mystery in this book that by the end, I was breathless like a trout out of water. Second, it answered some of the questions that have been hanging in books 3, 4 and 5 but leaving a slight cliffhanger at the end...just enough to make everyone happy and thrilled to read the last book. Third, the oozing teenage romance of our young heroes made my heart flutter and my stomach queasy with anticipation. And I totally admire that JK portrayed it in a funny, wholesome way unlike some other books out there that takes advantage of the whole romantic angle in an attempt to save the book. Fourth, I love how JK Rowling chose HBP for tracing Tom Riddle\\'s life history. It was very well timed and did not feel like the whole Riddle\\'s story was inserted to make the pages longer. Fifth, JK Rowling\\'s consistency with the characters, their interactions, and dialogues have always been a reason to look forward in reading and re-reading the books. There was never a time that I didn\\'t smile every time a sarcastic remark or a punch line is delivered. And to emphasize this, I love the new character introduced in this book, Professor Slughorn. He\\'s an outrageous, overenthusiastic glutton that dots on Harry every opportunity that he got. Maybe an older version of Colin Creevey? Sixth, I just love everything about HBP: the more serious tone, Harry\\'s obsession with what Draco\\'s up to, Slughorn, Harry\\'s unashamed credit taking for his new potion brilliance (at least he\\'s being authentic. Ha! ), Ron\\'s newly found hobby (snogging in public), Harry\\'s moment of finally finding the right girl (spoiler), the lessons with Dumbledore, and Riddle\\'s life being dissected. But there\\'s one thing that made me mad about this book. WHY? WHY does Jo need to be sadistic in taking something that we all learned to love? Isn\\'t it enough that we are completely in pain for Harry\\'s past? Isn\\'t Harry\\'s past losses painful enough to feel the need to strike him with another blow? *sighs and cries* To wrap this review, HBP is an excellent spectacle to set the stage for the final book. It tidied up the loose ends from the previous books without spoiling your hunger for the next book. A must-read even for the most reluctant HP readers out there. Favorite quote: \"And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\" I really enjoyed this book in the series. It\\'s at the top with Prisoner of Azkaban. I especially loved all the background information on Voldemort that the movies skipped over. A really fast read and highly enjoyable! This series is so sporadic with quality it astounds me. There is no real middle ground; I either love, or I hate the book, and I can say for Half-Blood Prince, it\\'s the former. This book is amazing. It has suspense, and romance, and humor, and heart-break, and even with everything going on I wasn\\'t bored! There wasn\\'t a moment where I was waving my hand and huffing because two [or more] characters were taking a billion years to figure out the obvious, nor were there spots where I was growling at the characters for being idiots. Also, without spoiling anything, I\\'m gonna hint real quick here...You all should know by now how much I love love-stories that have been budding and growing for YEARS (years, people, YEARS!). And we see that here... And this makes me very happy. All in all I REALLY enjoyed this installment in the series, and I\\'m very much hoping the next one (the final book) won\\'t disappoint.. I like to end on a bang. The best book in the series! Amazing! So first off the confession: I am relatively sure this was my first read through. I remember the night this book came out. I went to the midnight event with a friend even though I didn\\'t have a book reserved. I remember when she came bursting into our room into the whee hours of the morning sobbing that Dumbledore was dead (honestly if you don\\'t know it yet it\\'s not my problem). I\\'m relatively sure I watched the movie. Okay so yes I am still fighting off the last of the sniffles. I have not watched or read anything about the seventh year I\\'ve only heard things. Things like that Snape was good all along and the crazy fan girls were vindicated. I looked at Ben at one point tonight and said I will never like Snape. He is like the brutal soldier in movies who hates everything and enjoys the fighting. He might be fighting for the good guys but the hatred still boils inside you. If Rowling manages to when me over in number 7, well she has already earned her fame. Oh I do have another confession! Even though I knew the story of this book I totally forgot that the Half-Blood Prince was Snape! I can\\'t imagine the next book honestly and so I will cut this short and go disappear. (This is the sixth book of the Harry Potter series.) I\\'ve been spoiled a lot about this series but not about what happens at the end of this one. Which means it all took me by surprise and I cried like a baby. And then I talked to my boyfriend about it and started crying like a baby again. I need a break before I read the final book. Also, Harry/Dumbledore in this is what makes it for me. Review from previous reading, Dec 31 2008: This book gets sticky for me at a few places. When Harry\\'s kind of too busy stalking Draco to think about anything else he really got on my nerves. Bleh. But other than that it\\'s actually one of the most engaging of the series...which is saying something. I love the parts with Dumbledore in them. Even moreso than in any of the other books - Dumbledore is hilarious. He\\'s truly at his best when faced with death. I also like how he get short with Harry in this one, finally acts more like you\\'d expect him to and less...patient all the time. Seriously, anyone who reads this and immediately goes into The Deathly Hallows? I don\\'t see how you can dislike Dumbledore. After a long break....maybe. But I just love the characterization. It brought a lump to my throat every time someone mentioned Sirius, too, so it wasn\\'t just Harry. Reviews will be after this month due to conflicting schedules Note: Already read two years ago, but because I just remembered to check, so there it goes. The only thing I didn\\'t like about this book was Dumbledore\\'s death. Yes, I am finally breaking down. Read in two days (possibly even one day- not sure) after being acquired from the Ariel\\'s (former bookseller in New Paltz) release party. A lovely reread. First time since watching and rewatching the movie. Two things were better in the movie. The rest is better in the book. Although the movie does make a nice condensed version. I wish they had shown Dumbledore\\'s funeral. The dialogue between Harry and Dumbledore during the drinking of the potion in the cave is much better in the book. Dunno why it was all \"Please\" in the movie. I thought those people knew dialogue. Anyway, there is a lot of reveal at the end that could perhaps have been shown at other points. All in all, a good story. Wonderful characters. Ms. Rowling is very inventive. Too much. Just too much. One of the best books I\\'ve ever read. It was revealing how much more first person it is than the movies, which is one treat of written stories, and I understand a bit better just how single-minded Harry can be. Rowling\\'s characterisations are amazing and there\\'s just so many characters to revel in while following the adventure of Half-Blood Prince. Especially loved the budding romance of Harry and Ginny, and hers is a magnificent character, too. If you\\'ve only seen the movie, like I had for a long time, I suggest sitting down for a few nights with this charming, modern classic work of fantasy. Here, Harry\\'s almost lost everything he\\'s ever loved. Still grieving for Sirius he remains mostly the same. I like that here Harry mostly doesn\\'t have to deal with most of the problems that he shouldn\\'t be having on his shoulder his age. He has a more sense of normalcy than in the other books where he\\'s depended upon. Harry Potter will always be my favorite book series. Half Blood Prince I especially loved b/c Snape is my favorite character from the books and I loved learning bits from his past. I read through this book so fast just to get it out of the way so I could finish the series, to be honest. This was my least favourite installment. Again, when I read it I was too young to appreciate the conversations telling historical stories about the history of certain characters. Even looking back on the series though, this wasn\\'t my favourite. If it were possible to skip over it and understand the final book, I would have. Probably my second favorite of the series. I love the development of Ginny Weasley into such a central character. Part of me wishes for a spin-off of her last year at Hogwarts. Reader thoughts: And it gets darker. There are quite a few things I don\\'t like about this book, and it\\'s not because the book is poorly written. It\\'s just because so many bad things happen to our characters. The plotting is still good. riter thoughts:Dumbledore had to die, of course. he mentor character can\\'t stay throughout the entire hero\\'s journey. arry can\\'t become his own hero if Dumbledore is always there for him.  suppose Dumbledore could have been incapacitated another way, but then the next book would have been about saving Dumbledore rather than stopping Voldemort. aybe Voldemort could have kidnapped Dumbledore and kept him in a coma or in stasis in some way? aybe to gloat over? ind of like a Han Solo carbonite freezing. t\\'s happier, but that has other problems. It\\'s amazing how long I can take to read a book half this size, but an HP book I can blow through in a matter of hours. I swear, the first two times I read this book, I didn\\'t like it very much. Third time, a couple of the scenes between Harry and Dumbledore choked me up. This time, I thoroughly embarrassed myself systematically losing my shit every few chapters. I still have a lot of problems with this book, sometimes Harry is a little too snotty to be palatable and the plot gets weak in points, but Harry Potter books have an inherent, insatiable charm that always hits me right in the feels. I feel like my soul just got trampled on. I haven\\'t cried this much since Augustus Waters happened. If it weren\\'t for the romance subplots, which I still hate (sorry Jo), this might be my favorite book of the series. I love the backstory on Tom Riddle, and learning about the horcruxes. That\\'s pretty much all I have to say :P I don\\'t know if I\\'m emotionally prepared to read Deathly Hallows now. Aaah. Harry Potter is Amazing and J.K. Rowling can do no wrong! ** spoiler alert ** I tend to think of this volume as an interesting, almost quirky point in the Harry Potter series. It continues the dark tone set by Order of the Phoenix, punctuated by near-deaths, macabre happenings, and the brutal loss of a beloved character. It also effectively serves as the first part of the series conclusion, with the pivotal, much foreshadowed war between the forces of good and evil well underway. However, unlike the books directly before and after, much of Half-Blood Prince hearkens back to the first books by focusing largely on the daily happenings at school. Rowling continues to have much of the action that impacts the story\\'s climax happen in the drawing room. While some take issue with this, I have found it to be an interesting and effective way of ensuring that the story is told primarily from Harry\\'s point of view, so that his surprises are also the reader\\'s surprises. This is handled in a better fashion than in my favorite volume, Goblet of Fire; while the end of that book made the behind-the-scenes action more noticeable, Half-Blood Prince unfolds more gradually, with periodic acknowledgments of the other side\\'s shadowy actions and a conclusive final gambit. This book also echoes the exposition-heavy feeling of Order of the Phoenix. As less kind reviewers have pointed out, a large portion of this book is dedicated to Dumbledore showing Harry bits and pieces of Voldemort\\'s past. On its first reading and as a standalone book, this makes for a somewhat slow and meandering plot, but I feel that it makes sense in context of the entire series. The fourth book introduced the grim direction of the story\\'s second half, the fifth book gave insight into the good guys, and this one gives insight into the bad guy; now the reader is ready for the conclusion. I very much enjoyed the peeks into Voldemort\\'s backstory, as they helped make more sense of the character (rather than dismissing him as being evil for evil\\'s sake). Also of note is the reflection of Harry\\'s predicament from the previous book; whereas before he was determined he knew what to do and was proven unfortunately incorrect, this time his instinct is correct from the beginning, and nobody will listen to him. Both instances prove to have dire consequences (the least of which is Harry\\'s irritating teenaged sulking and yelling, which I have to admit is authentic from a character standpoint, even if it bugs the hell out of me). The most refreshing part of Half-Blood Prince, however, is the return to the charm and levity of Hogwarts itself, even with the sinister undercurrent. Most of the action in the book takes place in or between classes once again, and the serious business of the main story is broken up by Quidditch, classwork, and young romance. This feels like a final acknowledgement of the relatively benign setting introduced in the first Harry Potter books, and it instills the same mixture of nostalgia and wonder that those books did. Furthermore, it makes the events of the book\\'s main story more jarring and emotional, as they occur over and around both the light-hearted magic and everyday teenaged conundrums of Hogwarts, and culminate in a direct assault on both within the school itself. Of course, any discussion of this book would be incomplete without covering.... ...SPOILER.... ...the death of Dumbledore. This falls neatly within the confines of the version of the monomyth that Rowling has heretofore created; with Dumbledore gone, Harry loses his mentor and last confidant, and is therefore as prepared as he\\'s going to get to venture forth and defeat the villain, which is what he immediately sets out to do in the last chapter. While Dumbledore is given Rowling\\'s usual abrupt death scene, he is also given a touching remembrance through character reactions and an elaborate funeral, which serves as the setting for Harry\\'s next decisions. The impact of his death is immediately and profoundly felt by both characters and readers, especially considering how much time was spent during the book endearing the reader to Dumbledore. Always a whimsical and comforting character, even with his aura of power and authority, Half-Blood Prince establishes his benevolence to the point of laying it on a little thick. Nevertheless, his death leaves a palpable feeling of uncertainty as Harry prepares to face Voldemort and kill or be killed, setting just the right epic tone for the end of this book and the beginning of the final volume. I found that I liked this book much more the second time I read it, just like Order of the Phoenix. The characters are fully realized by this point, and react to situations in more realistic ways. Half-Blood Prince strikes an interesting balance between the fantastic and the macabre, and while not perfect from a story standpoint, it does a fine job of maintaining the overall story arc\\'s rhythm. This book also connects loose ends and throwaway moments from previous books into brilliant character and story setpieces, revealing Rowling\\'s penchant for grand designs and planning ahead. Further, if you are an unapologetic Harry Potter fan like me, Half-Blood Prince serves as an examination of some of the series\\' most interesting characters (Severus Snape first and foremost among them). On to reread the finale! ** spoiler alert ** I\\'ve always felt that this is the book where shit gets real. This keeps with Rowling\\'s habit of upping the ante the older her characters (and her readers growing up with the characters) get. It\\'s fantastically well written and enjoyable. I don\\'t remember if we get full details in \\'The Deathly Hallows\\' on Snape\\'s betrayal, but I\\'m going to be pissed if there\\'s not. I had to revisit this one after watching the movie for the first time. Was the movie based on this book? Ah, that damn old fool. I have to give it up to Harry for having great instincts and for fighting for what he believes in and for his best friends for putting up with that hero complexion of his (I mean where he wants to take the world all on his own). Got to prepare for the waterworks in the next book. Rereading this book was wonderful. It\\'s still tied for my favourite with book 3 despite the end. It\\'s the last book that takes place with some normality, and I like that. Yet Harry and his friends are older and the stakes are higher than they have been thus far. There\\'s also a great mystery winding its way through the storyline, and that keeps it interesting the entire time! I really need to go to Harry Potter World in Orlando... I can\\'t. OW DARE YOUUUUUU KILLL DUMBLEDOREEEEEE HE CANNOT DIEEEEEEEEEEE AEFAOPIHDF;ASDHA;LDJN;SAND;ALSND HE\\'S THE MOST POWERFUL GOOD WIZARD GODDEMITTTTTTTTQRNAO;HRAOJSDAJSD h my God I can\\'t believe Rowling killed Dumbledore.  can\\'t believe this. hat\\'s the most absurd thing ever. o wonder there\\'s so much of Dumbledore in this book.  thought it was weird having him around more than ever. heir meetups also show how patient Dumbledore is and how a good wizard he is. nd then you kill him!!  am so mad at Severus Snape I can\\'t. e was pleading to him. umbledore was pleading to him \"Please..Severus..\" and you AvadaKadavra him!! ow dare you!! ow dare you!!! e need to find Snape and kill him now please. ow! rgh I\\'m so mad at him I can\\'t. hen I read it, I refused to believe it.  thought Dumbledore had some trick up his sleeve like maybe clone himself or anything but when it finally hit me, I can\\'t. is character shouldn\\'t have died. ut what Harry said in the end is right, he is now all alone without any adult or parent figure to stand between him and Voldemort. his is how it should be. e have to face him alone. nitially, I thought this book is kinda a fallback after The Order of Pheonix but the ending takes it all.  mean the book was kinda...not slow..but focuses on mundane things too much even for Harry. hat\\'s with his suspicion towards Malfoy that seems childish sometimes, the love stories between them, the half-blood prince book, the private lesson with Dumbledore, etc. ut like I said, the ending takes it all. tw, I really like how Harry got together with Ginny. t\\'s like sort of happen but in the right way and they should totally not break up at the ending though I think they will get together again soon in the final book. h no it\\'s the final book already!!  can\\'t do this! \\'m not ready to leave this world. O!!! -------Edit after almost 12 hours------------  am still so mad at Snape right now.  can\\'t believe Dumbledore died just like that. t the hand of the person he trusted nonetheless! uch treason! nape should not ever be forgiven no matter how remorseful he is after this. ut even so, Dumbledore died still believing in good in people. e still trust Snape even to the last straw. f you must know, I haven\\'t watch the movie before this.  think I only watched the first few and the final one. nd I never really pay attention to the spoiler cos I always try to avoid one as much as I can so Dumbledore\\'s death came as a real shock to me. \\'m just few years late lol. nd the movie, Oh my God, it is so dull! t doesn\\'t do any justice to the book! he book is so full with feelings all the time but the movie lack of those. ntil the end of the book, Harry is still full with anger and fury but in the movie, Harry goes like \"Wow I can\\'t believe how beautiful it is from here\" like =.=! nd there was no Dumbledore\\'s funeral!! nd Ginny made the first move in the movie!  really like how Harry kiss Ginny first out of the heat of the moment. h well. Still good. Listening to audio books at double speed can get you through a tome like this much faster. I liked this one a lot. It\\'s great to finally know the background of He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named. I\\'m furious with Dumbledore for trusting Snape. Why was he so retarded?? It wasn\\'t hard to tell he was still working for Voldemort ever since the first book. I\\'m still hoping that Harry gets with Hot Hermione. I don\\'t care what you think of me, this book is damn good. ** spoiler alert ** After I was horribly disappointed with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I took a year to read book 6. Book 6 was back to form, Harry wasn\\'t a moody, whiny teenager and the plot was fast and engaging. I really enjoyed the back story of Voldemort. I\\'m a little disappointed that Snape and Malfoy behaved exactly as they had been set up to behave all series. I had hoped they might have a redeeming moment, and they may yet, but it\\'s kind of like reading a murder mystery only to find out the red herring really did do it. ******Spoilers****** Why is it that I can\\'t believe when characters die in this series?? I\\'m still not convinced that Sirius is gone. I guess I believe Dumbledore really did die, but it lacks the emotional punch that it should have had. I think it\\'s because they\\'re wizards and they should be able to wave their wands or mutter a curse and save themselves. Anyway, I can\\'t wait to get my hands on book 7 and see how it all ends. Too bad it\\'s got to wait until after I can read Mockingjay!! Vote: 4,75 Class: L-A2 (FP) (second to last of the Harry Potter saga) Great, just great! I\\'m at loss of words to describe these unbelievable amazing books. I\\'m re-reading the series ten years after the last reading and I\\'m finding it just as wonderful, and I can\\'t wait to begin move forward to the final one. I adore the characters, the beautiful writing style, the story with all its twists. And this is not, definitely, a children book but it\\'s simply put a great book. Like I said before I can\\'t point out what is the best thing about this series but I really think this is one of the best book I\\'ve ever read. Certainly worth re-reading and recommending. One of my all-time best book. know that Snape had a reason for everything he did, and we find this out in the 7th book, but his betrayal hits me hard every time. owever, it makes me very happy that he does not allow Draco to kill Dumbledore. This entire book is dark. I feel like it is the darkest of all the books. I remember reading it for the first time and not grasping all of it because of that. However, as I got older and read it again (and also once the movie came out and helped), I understood some of the subject matter better and I enjoyed the story better. In this lead up to the grand finale in the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling ratchets up the tension in another strong installment. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince deviates a little from the \"formula\" beginnings and endings that we\\'ve come to expect from the series. Rowling also keeps readers guessing about Snape\\'s true loyalty. hile...Dumbledore\\'s death along with Harry\\'s decision not to return to Hogwarts but instead pursue Voldemort both raise the stakes considerably. . Bottom line: J.K. Rowling continues to deliver: new characters, intricate web of subplots, and continued development of the core characters with a few surprises along the way. ** spoiler alert ** I enjoyed the 6th entry of the series much more than book 5. I particularly like that Rowling gives the readers a taste of Lord Voldemort\\'s backstory. I found it fascinating to see how he went from an angry orphan with a penchant for stealing from and hurting others to a sinister adult with a hidden agenda. This book easily serves as a bridge between Harry\\'s timeline and how Tom Riddle became Voldemort. My only issue with the story is that even though Snape suspects Harry of having the half-blood prince\\'s potion book, he never pursues and/or proves it because Harry hides it within the Room of Requirement. Considering the idea of the half-blood prince is in the title, I figured there should have been more resolve. I really did not see any of what happened in this book coming - it was the beginning of the end and I loved it. It was amazing to finally learn more about Snape and to be left doubting everything that I thought about him and the story in general before. I\\'m glad I read this when the seventh was already out, otherwise I may have died from anticipation :). Best book out of the series! It was (one of) my favorite HP movies as well so that was to be expected, but I think the book added a lot of depth to the story that the movie was maybe lacking a bit (even though the movie is very entertaining). Especially concerning Dumbledore\\'s death (this doesn\\'t need to be marked as a spoiler anymore, does it? XD Come on, you should know this by now) and Voldemort\\'s past. Everything just made more sense in the book and therefore the tension was more palpable. I loved how they develop romantic relationships in this book - makes it feel a lot more Young Adulty, which I like! Ron and Hermione <3 Also, book Ginny is so much more awesome than movie Ginny, it\\'s true. FIVE STARSSSS! Read (to Greg) Nov 2005 (Reread June 2016) Still 5 stars! I\\'ll make this review short. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince started with the conversation of the Minsiter of Magic with the Prime Minister of the muggle world (really, I loved this part. It\\'s hilarious haha!) and ended with a breathless moment in the history of Harry Potter series ;) Although the book kind-of focused on teenagers feelings of love, angst, care and whatsoever, it didn\\'t ruin the book because it lightened some of the sinister mood from previous HP series. I will leave this review with an utmost appreciation for Albus Dumbledore. I admire how his usual calm expression guides Harry into a world much darker. Harry\\'s clear dedication still fights with the idea that he could use his magic only for the good and absolutely not for evil. The Half Blood Prince has the best ending in the series so far. However, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Order of The Phoenix will still remain as my favorite HP series ever. :p We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on. -- Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'"

       "'The war against Voldemort is not going well: even Muggle governments are noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of The Daily Prophet looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. And yet... As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. So it\\'s the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Harry struggles to uncover the identity of the Half-Blood Prince, the past owner of a potions textbook he now possesses that is filled with ingenious, potentially deadly, spells. But Harry\\'s life is suddenly changed forever when someone close to him is heinously murdered right before his eyes. With Dumbledore\\'s guidance, he seeks out the full, complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort, and thereby attempts to find what may be his only vulnerability.\\n--scholastic.com One of the best books in the series I think. It only gets better as the suspense builds in this terrific, mysterious tale of possible double-crossing and virtuousness that delivers the best emotional mix of good versus evil on both a meta- and micro- scale since the Allies versus the Axis in the Second World War. First of all, Im in love with these books since I was 12 years old, and I got my first book for Christmas. I was hooked then, and I am still now, several years, books, movies and theme parks later. Once piece of me will always dream about this magical world, and Hogwarts will always be my home. Having said that, this is my least favorite book. I enjoyed learning about Voldemort\\'s past, but it took way too much of the book and the school year and it wasn\\'t that much worth it. The other characters, Ron and Hermione, are flat and lack of any flavor; they just leave Harry alone and submerge themselves in a teen world filled of hormones. I really didn\\'t like how they suddenly, form one book to another, are so superficial and blind, and cant care less about Harry and Voldemort. To me it just doesn\\'t make any sense. I cried a lot at the end of this book. I know this had to happen, but it still huts when I think about it. But I knew the true from the beginning, I knew it couldn\\'t be as Rowling was showing us and who was actually an allied in disguise. If you are expecting a book full of action, this is definitively not it. But this need to happen in order to give room to the final book, the one that changes everything. I just hoped it could have been more fun to read. This book didn\\'t disappoint me at all. I absolutely love the charming aspect of this book and book series. It\\'s sad that this book series is almost over. I can\\'t get enough of it! 5 stars! Urgh. Reread December 2016 for Harry Christmas to You. This is another one that I\\'d forgotten pretty big parts of. If I had to pick a least favorite Harry Potter book, this would probably be it. It was a really interesting book, and there were certain small parts that I absolutely loved, but as a whole, it just didn\\'t quite measure up to my rereads of the rest. Reread December 2014 for Harry Christmas to You. I literally have no words. I feel like half the blood left my heart. I\\'m devastated. I think we can all agree that the basics are all the same in this series. You can\\'t arrive at your review of the sixth book and pretend that you\\'ll be saying anything new about the writing, world building, characters and development, plot progression and execution, etc. As always, all of these elements are impeccable in this sixth and second-to-last installment. I enjoyed it a bit more than the last one because our teenagers are feeling a little less angsty and are just about on the brink of adulthood. Well, Hermione and Ron, by wizarding standards, have or will have come of age during or shortly after this book, having turned 17. Harry will follow, of course, in July of the seventh book, which is usually where our books pick up. We have some added romance by way of Ron and Lavender... uh.. and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny. I don\\'t particularly think romance is a strong suit for Rowling - she really is a genius by way of mystery and fantasy, but I didn\\'t completely buy the Harry-Ginny thing. I\\'ve always felt a bit like that and I really made an effort to connect with them a bit more this time to see if I was maybe missing something, but I feel like I only made a small bit of progress. I like the idea of it, of favorite characters in a favorite series being together. I just didn\\'t like the execution and didn\\'t really feel much of the chemistry with them. I\\'ve never really felt that way about Hermione and Ron because their feelings for eachother are hinted at earlier on in the series and its easy to accept what you\\'ve been hoping for all that time. However, I did realize that I didn\\'t feel much in the way of chemistry on that front either, but like I said, it just is... meant to be... so it didn\\'t really bug me. The ending of this book still shocks me to the core no matter how many times I\\'ve read it or watched it play out on the big screen. I just hate it, though I know it serves a much bigger purpose. I tried hard to study Snape and his actions and dialogue, because really, we all know what happens, but I\\'d just like to understand it better. Something I\\'ve never understood, even from book one, was Snape\\'s rage and hatred toward Harry... or well, anyone who isn\\'t like Snape himself, I guess. I get the whole thing with his dad and the friends, but come on. Aren\\'t we all grown ups here? Well, again, I know it all serves a higher purpose, but its something I could never quite come to terms with. I can understand being cold and detached, but there were times throughout the series that Snape was downright cruel and even in this book, knowing what we know about book 7... I guess I won\\'t go getting all spoilery for the random person living under a rock who hasn\\'t read the book. There isn\\'t much else to say about this book other than how much I loved it and truly enjoyed it deep down in my bones. I\\'ve only read the last two books once before so I loved going through it all again, being able to study the parts that once confused me and really see deeper into the books. Though it was heartwrenching, it was enchanting and wonderfully done and I think it did the series justice. Its still going to take some time for me to figure out how I feel about it in reference to the other books. Definitely more toward the top of the list and there are only 7, so its not like they can all be my favorite. Re-read this book in 2007 in anticipation of the final book. One of my favorite books in the series. That ending still hits me hard.. so heartbreaking ** spoiler alert ** Not my favorite of the series, especially since Dumbledore died, but of course I loved it because I love all the Harry Potter books. This book seemed to be much more well-paced than the previous two. I enjoyed it a lot, and noticed a certain depth to it that the rest of preceding books lack. I think it may be the fact that Dumbledore plays a much larger roll. I also think that Rowling\\'s writing has improved with each book. On to the last book of my Harry Potter re-read-through! a bucketful of tears and a grin (because of the next generation of kids going into Hogwarts). That\\'s how i ended reading this series this year. Excellent. Always love JK Rowling. Not my favorite. It seems to be an aside from the main story arc of the series. Unpredictable! Harry Potter and the half-blood prince will make you figure out the puzzle. This book is so good. I remember reading it for the first time (how I wish I could have that experience again!) and just feeling my brain buzzing with the delight and excitement of finally putting the events of the previous books into their true context. Now, reading it again for the upteenth time, it has lost none of its charm and intensity. I know I\\'ll be reading it again many more times! Severus Snape. Best character ever written. Seriously, if you haven\\'t read this series, you are depriving yourself of one of the most magical experiences of your literary life. Fantasy must be for real... This is my favorite of the first six books. I loved it, though the end was so sad. I liked reading the Harry potter saga, but this book was not one of the best. It is as entertaining as the previous ones, but it lacks originality, and it is quite similar to all the others. This book and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows are my two favourites from the series. I remember getting this book on the midnight release and reading it consistently for 48 hours (with no sleep, no food, and no getting up from my chair!) I would re-read them again and again (if I had the time!). An absolute must-read for everyone, at least once in your life. Just put everything on hold cause this book just ripped me apart!! No words... cannot believe dumbledore died . irst sirius now him . his sucks and i know there will be more deaths coming but i just cant help it . hy ? his book was good no doubt the story line and everything but why dumbledore i could have waited till the last book you know *sobs* ow harry is completely alone no one to look after him *sobs again* Love this book. Harry Potter is a fun series. But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world. 11/1/2016: My favorite book in the entire series.. I still cry toward the end. Must -- reread -- before -- the movie -- comes out! Here\\'s the thing: I read this once to myself, once out loud to the family, listened to the audio, and am now re-reading before going to see the movie. Despite knowing everything that is going to happen, all the secrets and twists, this is so enjoyable! I\\'m as riveted as ever. This is probably my least favourite of the Harry Potter series. While it had more technical skill than the previous installment, in my opinion, the tone of the thing was just so different from the other books. What I remember most about it was the romances that abound, not the magic or the mystery. Surely I loved this one, but was also a bit disappointed as I expected something different to happen :( As I am re-reading (in audio format) in a short period of time all the Harry Potter books, I\\'ve realised that despite this one still being quite good it\\'s also, in my opinion, the weakest of the series. There is very little action and it\\'s mostly a volume to dump a lot of information on Voldemort and also to raise the expectations for the last and 7th volume. Still reading a bit each night with my son, this was by far my favorite book yet! So much happiness in this book; Harry finds out what his future entails, he suffers through a devastating loss, he confirms that some of his suspicions were accurate and he even gets to experiences some romance too! I personally didn\\'t love any of the books until this one. This particular installment really had everything. I was completely sucked into the Dr\\'s (especially the last half), the romance aspects for realistic and brought back lots of memories. I even laughed out loud several times. This book is action-packed, leaving me very eager for the grand finale! This is one of the best books I have ever read. It has amazing parallels of good vs evil and OH MY GOSH! It\\'s my favorite book in the series so far. umbledore by far is the most noble man I have ever heard about... The way he carried himself, expressed himself, and loved others has resonated with my heart so deeply! e was an amazing man, and I cried with tears of sorrow when he died. e made this book beautiful. arry Potter quite proved himself in this book as well. e has shown that he will fight the battle against Voldemort sacrificing the prospects of love and forging past the loss of Dumbledore, symbolic for protection and guidance. arry Potter is a true man with amazing morale. . I LOVE THIS BOOK! Holy cow. It is such a good, heart-wrenching read! Wow! ** spoiler alert ** That was pretty enjoyable. Even though I had seen meme\\'s about Snape Killing Dumbledore, I was still surprised when it happened. I don\\'t like how this book and the last just wind on and on after the pinnacle of the excitement. I don\\'t need to know who all attended Dumbledore\\'s funeral and that the merpeople sang for him and on and on. Maybe I would feel differently if I were really into it and I was reading it as it came out and not having all that formality in the way of me starting the next book. REREAD 2015 This is always the saddest book in the series for me :( REREAD 2013 It\\'s been almost 6 years since I last read Half-Blood prince. I\\'m so glad I decided to re-read this HP book. It\\'s just one of the strongest books in the series and I think this is one of my favorites in the series. So many feels though ;_; Everytime I finished one Harry Potter book I always said, I think this is my fave from all. So it turns out I have 4 fave fave books from this series.. Does it even make sense? I could only sigh. Last read Dec 8-10, 2010 Well other than Barry being a whiny brat I loved this book. they grow with you you\\'re not reading about a 16 year old in 11 year old language that\\'s nice ahw Dumbledore ))): I still can\\'t stop thinking about the ending of this book. And, I was even having dreams about Dumbledore last night after i finished it too. I mean, wth, seriously? While the Half-blood Prince is right up there with Prisoner of Azkaban for me, this one has been the most emotionally gripping and challenging so far. I\\'m still sad, confused, and worst of all, I feel betrayed - not only by the plot, but also by JRo. Why did you have to do this to Harry, to us readers? Why does evil always have to lurk its malevolent head around at the worst possible time? What happened to the happy endings of the first 3 years at Hogwarts? Well, I\\'m hoping the answers will come in Year 7, as I\\'m sure they will, and, more so than any of the others, I can\\'t wait to get started. Sigh...the only one he ever feared, yes indeed, the only one. JK Rowling must have done quite an elaborate series outline before writing the Harry Potter books! I was struck by how so many threads in previous books were coming together. I think this was the toughest one to read yet. I found it a little slower than the other books. I also had put it down in order to focus on book reviews and other life stuff. It\\'s been interesting to read Harry Potter and watch him grow up with adult eyes. Reread 2017 - this book was ruined for me by spoilers a day after it came out. This read was more enjoyable by far. I seem to have a theme for each Harry novel and this one was no exception, I like to refer to it as the Teenager Era. Yes, hormones are running rampid and Harry, is in love, is jealous, is fighting, and generally is just growing up. The entire novel reads almost like a prologue to the upcoming finale (except for the fact that its over 600 pages long). Things have stepped up a notch as the Wizarding world finally begins to acknowledge that the Dark Lord has returned, the Minister of Magic has been sacked as Knightbolt installed in his place. Under pressure to become the PR face of the Ministry, Harry returns to Hogwarts to discover Snape in the DADA position with Slugworth, an arrogant name dropping past professor of his parents now teaching Potions. The school terms become a series of papers and homework as Harry struggles to keep up, with the help of a Potions textbook, previously owned by one Half-Blood Prince. The events of the last few chapters seem almost isolated from the rest of the novel as it all rushes towards the tragic (and almost universally predicted) conclusion, truly setting the stage for the end. A much better read than the Angry Harry novel, but too many loose ends to be all that memorable. Good book, sadly not nearly as good as her other books. I have high hopes for the seventh book. I just hope she can pull off the darker feeling and still keep the plot in one piece. This brought out the darker side of the Magical world and how some students seemed to be able to fool Dumbledore... In the 6th Harry Potter book, Harry is using an old textbook for his potions class. Only he seems to be able to read the \"invisible\" ink that \"corrects\" some of the potions in the book. The book is signed \"Half-Blood Prince\". Harry is also taking personal lessons from Dumbledore. And more - actually a lot happens in this book! In fact more happened in this book than I remembered, and once again, I really enjoyed it, maybe more than the first time around. I listened to the audio narrated by Jim Dale. This is the third HP book I\\'ve listened to, narrated by him, and the fourth book I\\'ve listened to, overall, narrated by him. He\\'s finally growing on me and I finally see the appeal. He actually does do some very good effects while narrating, and it\\'s often easy to pick out who is speaking, just by the voices he does. ** spoiler alert ** Dumbledore dies? After all that? Snape is bad, after all the \"I trust him\" crap from D and the Order?! Arrgghh! I was not happy with this one. Very disappointed and sad . I wanted things to be happier, even though it\\'s a serious thing happening now, but still . Things tended to work out in the other books, but this one ends on a down beat. I hope the last one has some redeeming stuff. (A great series, all that aside). There\\'s a lot about this book I enjoy but I feel like there\\'s not much that happens. It\\'s just setting us up for the last book, which is appropriate. It\\'s a good thing I like the relationship aspect of this story or I think I would have been bored by this book. I sort of feel like she was getting tired of writing about school stuff. Harry is extra annoying here. \"Rawr, Draco. I hate Draco. I\\'m ANGRY. Voldemort isn\\'t controlling me anymore but let me argue with my best friends because EVERYTHING IS MALFOY\\'S FAULT.\" Females, especially teenage girls, do very strange things for revenge. Even knowing the ending, it hurts a bit to read. I watched the interview with Jim Dale in which he describes how he created the many, many voices of Rowling\\'s wonderful books. In it he mentions that he doesn\\'t like the word actor. He believes that the performer shouldn\\'t act the character, he should be the character. And, wow does he succeed! Jim Dale is bloody brilliant! I would listen to him read anything. Last time I read it: 4/2014 Reading this to Emma... October 24-26, 2012 - Rereading... October 25-27 2011 i think Half Blood Prince is now my favorite book of the series (hampir setara sm Goblet of Fire!) GA SIAP BUAT DEATHLY HALLOWS oh god I\\'ll write a joint review when I\\'m through the last book. Loved, loved, loved it! OotP starts getting into alot more action, and there\\'s even more in this book. I\\'ve read this book a few times and still tear up at the end. Re-read: 27/12/2016 This is probably my favorite Harry Potter book, mostly because even though it has a lot of sad and desperate moments, it also has a lot of bright ones (which is a nice change after Order of the Phoenix). Probably the most interesting part of Half-Blood Prince is all the time Harry spent with Dumbledore learning about Voldemort\\'s past. Another definite plus is, how to put it, romantic awaking of out main protagonists, although Ron and Hermione\\'s scenes were sometimes more than cringy. I was right there, standing next to Harry and feeling awkward during some of their conversations. What I really liked though was space Rowling gave Ginny. Although I\\'d still like to see even more of her, I can\\'t help but love what an amazing, funny and strong woman she is becoming. The ending, of course, left me heartbroken. ot only because of Dumbledore\\'s death, but also because of the pure fact that Harry won\\'t return to Hogwarts in the next book.  know that these books need to evolve, but I will REALLY miss Hogwarts with Ginny, Neville, Luna, McGonagall, etc. fter all, Hogwarts is Harry\\'s home. nd he\\'s already lost enough. All in all, re-reading these books is making me so devastated I\\'m really afraid to start reading the last one. But here we go anyway... My thoughts on this book are as follows: OMG DUMBLEDORE. That is all. Read: January 2009 December 2011 (Audiobook) November/December 2016 (Audiobook) This is the first book to make me ACTUALLY cry since TFIOS...not teary eyes, but SOBS. Bravo, JKR. Bravo. This is probably my most favorite Harry Potter book. It set the scene of what was going to happen in the Deathly Hallows. Also, this book gave more insight on Severus Snape. It also shows the burden that was placed on Draco and really how much he disliked it I\\'m really enjoying my re-read through the series. Jim Dale does an amazing job with the narration, and I don\\'t think these stories will ever get old for me. In this book we start to see the future romantical relationships between characters really crystallize, but my favorite part of Half-Blood Prince is the glimpses into Voldemort\\'s past. The flashbacks make the world seem fully-realized, a place that has always existed with its own rich history. I haven\\'t yet read any of the newly released Potterverse stories (I KNOW) but really, there is a reason that JKR is basically the richest person in the world. She has a fantastic imagination and I don\\'t even know how she managed to come up with all the details of the wizarding world. Like I said, I\\'m pretty sure these books will always amaze me. Always. I ugly cried through the last like, 75 pages of this book Lots of action in this one, although there were parts that seemed to drag a bit (mostly involving Slughorn, not one of my favorite characters). Harry does seem to be becoming more and more full of himself in this book, and at times I found myself sympathizing with Snape during their conversations. Others have criticized Hermione for her mooning over Ron, but I think she was presented as so serious, studious and older than her years in the first few books that the reader tends to forget she\\'s still a teenage girl and none of her actions are uncharacteristic for that age group. Cho Chang was MUCH more annoying, in my opinion, and I was happy that nothing developed there. I can\\'t believe there\\'s only one book to go (sadface). RIP Dumbledore This was my favorite out of the series, I loved how everything started coming together in this book. Reread in preparation for 7. Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter #6), by J.K. Rowling and Synopsis: The war against Voldemort is not going well; even Muggle governments are noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of the Daily Prophet, looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. And yet... As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate--and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. So it\\'s the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here at Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort--and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability. In A Sentence: My least favorite of the Harry Potter books, but still amazing My Thoughts: This book is such a whirlwind of....everything! Out of the seven books, I like this one the least, but that doesn\\'t mean this book isn\\'t awesome, no siree. Rowling did a great job depicting the life of a 16-year-old, I think. Their love lives, their attitudes, their opinions on what\\'s important, it was all in this novel, which is probably why this was my least favorite installment in the series (I\\'m not all that interested in teenage love stories, although some of these love stories were rather sweet). While there was a decent amount of action in this novel, I think what makes this book so good was the psychology behind it. There\\'s the psychology of a teenager, there\\'s the psychology behind good people and villains, there\\'s even psychology surrounding Voldemort and his past, which I found interesting (I kept asking my psychologist husband \"Is Voldemort a sociopath or a psychopath?\") Finally, there was that one part that, when I first read this, I couldn\\'t forgive Rowling for doing (if you\\'ve read this book, you know what I mean: that scene in the tower). In the final book, this part was satisfactorily explained, but I still hate the fact that the event happened! It was traumatic to read the first time around. Nowadays, I understand why it had to happen, but it still makes me very sad. Overall, I loved the story, but I can\\'t say it was ever my favorite. It\\'s the transitory story between Harry Potter the Kid, and Harry Potter the Man, and, like all middle stories, leaves you unsatisfied and ready for the final epic conclusion! Re-read 9/11/2012 I love Harry Potter so deeply I can\\'t even explain it. So much happens in this book, my heart is feeling all the feels, I was crying some minutes ago. GOSH I NEED A HUG. And as always, I just have to say it: Hagrid is perfection, what a precious character, he makes my heart melt, I adore him so so so much. 2nd best HP book After the prisoner of Azkaban ! I enjoyed every word in it ,, specially Voldemort\\'s history Incredible. Amazing. Took my breath away. Unlike everything I\\'ve ever read. Fantastic world. I especially liked the change of relationship between Ron and Hermione. They were so funny and sweet by moments. They are my favorite couple in the series, by the way. :D 3 RTCs in a row! I am drowning! First book I\\'m changing the rating for during this series re-read. I wish I\\'d written a review last time, because I don\\'t actually remember why I only gave this 3 stars before? It was my lowest personal rating of any book in the series, and I\\'ve also always considered it to be my least favourite of all the books. Which is...puzzling, I guess, because I really enjoyed it this time around. As with Order of the Phoenix, I\\'d forgotten a lot of the details but I just flew through it this week.  can only assume that a big part of my somewhat lower rating was the whole Harry/Ginny thing, which ... well, let\\'s be honest, I\\'m never going to be a fan of them but I\\'ve mostly gotten past it. ddly enough, I never shipped anyone the first time around, and that hasn\\'t changed.  don\\'t have any particularly strong feelings towards any of the couples.  would\\'ve preferred, for instance, Harry/Ron/Hermione to just stay best friends all their lives, without any couples being formed within their little group. f I absolutely HAD to choose between wanting Ron/Hermione and Harry/Hermione as a romantic pairing, I would have to choose the latter. ut even so, it wouldn\\'t be wholeheartedly; I all prefer them as friends. ostly because, in my opinion, Rowling\\'s strong suit just isn\\'t romance. \\'m not swooned by the way she writes it and I know we were supposed to believe that Ginny\\'s crush on Harry had just been put on the back-burner all these years, but as a result of the way she wrote it, I just didn\\'t buy it. his was less of an issue for Ron and Hermione, but honestly, Harry seems to notice Ginny from one day to the next (goodye, Cho!) nd then Ginny suddenly reveals she never really stopped hoping and lol, no. ut anyway, as I said before I\\'ve made my peace with it (or I\\'ve tried) and it bothered me less this time. I love this book for so many reasons - first and foremost the further character development, which really does seem to get better with each book - and the ending didn\\'t fail to turn me into a blubbering mess again. ut of all the deaths in these books, Dumbledore\\'s will always hit me the hardest.  may have cried less than I did the first time, but cry I did.  was being strong, up until the point where Harry follows McGonagall into Dumbledore\\'s office and there\\'s a new portrait on the wall, with the old Headmaster snoozing peacefully.  lost it, then. e is without a doubt one of my favourite characters, because he is all that is good in the world and yet Rowling made him flawed as well and I just.  LOVE HIM A LOT, OKAY. There was more I wanted to say, but I\\'ve forgotten it all in light of the ending. *Read: April 2011, June 2016 \"It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world.\" Great addition to an outstanding series. Harry and the gang are growing and learing more and more about Harry\\'s History as well as some pretty deep stuff concerning Snape. Amazing Series. I enjoyed a lot of the background information given in this story, and I loved how much time Harry was able to spend with Dumbledore. That ending though, made me tear up for the first time in the books and IT JUST WASN\\'T RIGHT, OKAY?? Old review I wrote on my blog (http://douglascootey.com) on 21 November 2005: Last summer I waited in line with my daughters for the most eagerly anticipated book of the year: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The book was well worth the wait. It was the best written since Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I pegged some events correctly and was surprised by others. I found the book entertaining, and would even recommend it to non-Harry Potter fans as a place to start the series. I\\'m going to be discussing some plot spoilers in this review so if that sort of thing bothers you you\\'ve just read my review in a nutshell and don\\'t need to read further. I had problems with Book Four, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Although I enjoyed much of what happened in the book the ending nearly killed me. Once we learned that Barty Crouch Jr. was posing as Moody we were treated to a full chapter of exposition as he recounted the entire story all over again, but from his point of view. I found it dreadfully dull and often skipped through it. Only this year did I learn that JK Rowling enjoys Dorothy Sayers and that Goblet of Fire\\'s ending fit the classic Sayers\\' style ending. I had problems with Book Five, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, as well. I found it overly long at times and in need of a good edit. Interestingly, JK Rowling felt the same. \"There are bits of all six books that I would go back and tighten up. My feeling is that Phoenix is overlong, but I challenge anyone to find the obvious place to cut.\" This isn\\'t to say that I didn\\'t enjoy those books. I\\'ve read them so many times I\\'ve lost count. I\\'m just saying that these books had flaws in execution and length. The same couldn\\'t be said for Book Six, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. This is the tightest book she\\'s written to date. The narrative was woven well. The characters were well fleshed out, there weren\\'t any personality changes pulled out of a hat like Ginny\\'s character in Book Five, and the back story balanced well with current events. Not only did we see an end to CAPS LOCK Harry, but exposition was much improved from earlier books. Instead of having the story explained from the mouths of Hermione, Dumbledore, or Crouch, we had pensieve episodes which worked much better in my opinion, proving the old writer\\'s adage: \"Show it, don\\'t tell it.\" This was a well written adventure story. Interestingly, I had three predictions proven to be true, which is good even for me. First, Dumbledore died, paving the way for Harry to finally stand on his own. Until now, and as Harry himself had pointed out in Book Five, he\\'s been very lucky and always saved by somebody else. Now there will be no teachers to rescue him. No guardian angels waiting in the wings. Our hero cannot be a hero until he fights insurmountable odds on his own. Second, we discovered the horcruxes. I had predicted a few years ago, based on events in Book Two, that Voldemort had obtained immortality by imbuing inanimate objects with his soul, as he had done with the dairy. I was delighted to be right about this one, and the third prediction: that it would be too much to expect the horcruxes to be laying about Hogwarts so Harry would have to go on a quest to find them. There are still mysteries to be revealed in Book Seven, such as the importance of Harry\\'s green eyes and how that relates to Lilly, his mother, or what significance his scar has yet to play beyond it\\'s iconic purposes. Book Six tied up enough loose ends to satisfy, but left enough untied to keep the reader looking forward to the next installment. Much has been made of how dark this book is compared to the others. I\\'m not sure where people\\'s heads have been. Harry Potter and the Sorceror\\'s Stone started with murder, abandonment, and child abuse. It was garnished with bullying, hinted with dark disembodied cloaks that fed on fresh unicorn blood, then topped with life threatening trials and ordeals. And that was all before facing the grand baddie himself. All that has changed is Harry has grown up, gone through his angry teenage years and now is ready to be a man. The framework for this was laid in the first book for this progression, but the books have always been dark. As for romances, much has been made about them as well, but JKR will not be known as a great romance novelist. The \"romance\" in the books is, as we Americans would put it, High School stuff. Meeting at lockers, making out in the equipment room, etc. No surprise there. They\\'re still students. We have yet to see if Harry and Ginny have the greatest written love scenes of teen fiction yet to come. In fact, I suspect that it is quite plausible for Ginny to die, sacrificing herself and protecting Harry with the same charm his mother once used on him, but I\\'m not holding my breath. The romance will be there, but secondary to the action and adventure experienced by our hero, Harry Potter. It is his story, told through his eyes, and unless Harry suddenly becomes a hopeless romantic the story\\'s narrative will focus on the same elements it always has. Could a Harry Potter fan ask for anything more? My appreciation for this sixth book in the series has grown since the last time I read it. It\\'s a much tighter story than I remembered, and the lead up to the tragic ending is a lot more evident on a second reading. I think a lot of what confused me about it now is the flashback scenes told in the Pensieve. I don\\'t think I quite grasped what was going on the first time, and I\\'m really not sure why, because it\\'s not a terribly difficult plot when you get right down to it. In any case, I found myself reading a lot faster and absorbing a lot more of the mythology behind Voldemort\\'s rise to power this time, and bits of Deathly Hallows are actually clearer now that I\\'ve gone back and re-read this one. There\\'s also a sense of urgency to this novel that the fourth and fifth books seemed to lack. This book doesn\\'t meander, it knows where it\\'s going and what it\\'s leading to, and I really appreciate that about this book. My review of the audiobook version Review from re-read in 2009: I\\'d forgotten how much fun this book is. I say fun, despite the last four or five chapters. The interaction between Harry, Hermione, and Ron was interesting and fun, especially the growing romantic dynamic between Hermione and Ron. Harry falling for Ginny, and his twisting emotions regarding \\'bros before hos\\' was good to read. The memories are, point blank, the best part of the book. The look into Voldemort\\'s past, and Harry\\'s reaction to how he lived and seeing the similarities between the two of them, were the perfect way to bring in facts about Voldemort without getting boring. The final scenes were amazing. The first one that I loved was Draco vs Dumbledore. The emotion coming from Malfoy were heart wrenching, and Dumbledore slowly losing strength and slipping down the wall just squeezed the heart to pieces. My favorite scene, and to be honest, the scene I was most looking forward to in the movie (NOT BITTER), was the final scene between Snape and Harry. Harry freaking out and throwing out a Crucio curse, then attempting Snape\\'s own spells on him, and Snape\\'s overwhelming fury. We\\'d never seen Snape lose it up to that point, it was always cold and quiet anger. For him to lose his shit so completely and proclaim himself the HBP was just amazing. I\\'m now itching to re-read book 7 after this. Ahhh, HP. How I miss you. I re-read this in anticipation of seeing the film. What can one say. The saga continues. The best aspect of this for me was the characterization of adolescence. I thought she hit a home run with that. Harry is a flawed hero, more than willing to take a short cut to help his grades, even if that means possible corruption. Ron and Hermione play sexual tennis, both wanting the other but neither able to take a direct approach. Harry is interested in Ginny, but takes a very Peter Parker role at the end in rejecting her for her own safety. The identity of the Half-blood prince is revealed at the end and provides a nifty twist. We are also strung along with the question of whether Snape is or isn\\'t working for the dark side. Is Dumbledore really gone, or has he found a way to preserve a portion of his soul by arranging his own death? There are talismans that are left unanalyzed that will no doubt provide the roots of the final book. It was a very enjoyable ride in the classic series of our time. A small pet peeve is that I think poor Ron deserves better than to be the ever-present comic relief. Even though I knew what was coming, even though I remembered this book much better than the others, I still couldn\\'t put it down. The relationship between Dumbledore and Harry is probably my favorite in the whole series, to say nothing of the character of Dumbledore himself. I find the scenes between the two of them, which drive much of this novel, to be some of Rowling\\'s best writing. Slughorn\\'s good fun too. As horrible as it seems to sound Tom Riddle, aka Lord Voldemort, has to be one of my favorite characters of all time. He\\'s a baddy, yes. He tries to kill off--and in some cases succeeded in doing so--some of the most beloved characters in this series, yes. However, his story and history is so amazingly developed that it has become an impossibility for me not to love this character. It\\'s a guilty pleasure. This book might as well consist entirely of Voldemort\\'s history, or a great deal of it anyhow, and for that I love it. Well done, Rowling! Beaten only by Order of the Phoenix, and that was by barely. Exact rating: 4.75 I didn\\'t like this as much but it was still BRILLIANT. But in the mean time, I\\'ve so much hate for this book, Dumbledore, Snape, Malfoy. I\\'ve literally never hated anybody as much as I\\'ve hated Snape in my 17 years of living. How dare he, that fucking son of a shit. alf blood prince? ore like prince of garbage. nd... and how can Rowling kill Dumbledore? sobs* I knew he\\'d die but I didn\\'t expect it to be effing Malfoy.  didn\\'t think I\\'ll cry when Dumbledore died, honestly, I didn\\'t fancy his character that much but the impact was bigger than expected. y heart breaks for everybody at Hogwarts. his is too much for me to express my feelings. I just can\\'t this is unacceptable. Another solid book of storytelling. The different plot lines weave together smoothly and compliment each other in terms of relevancy and interest. After watching the movie of this book, I concluded that I actually like the romance of Ginny and Harry much much better in the book. It\\'s sweeter and not as much of a surprise. They have longer to be together and that is nice, and Ginny, for some reason to me, is cooler in the book than she is in the movie. She\\'s the popular one while Harry is the well known one, which is slightly different than being popular. I continue to like this book very much and realize that things about the horcruxes and such make way more sense to me now. Not sure why - maybe I just read the book too fast the first time around. This had always been one of my faves in the series when I was younger, and I am happy to say that this is still one of my faves now too!!! Also I\\'ve been trying, throughout this whole series, to understand people who like Snape and justify his actions for everything, but honestly he\\'s just a horrible person. *heart breaks into a thousand tiny pieces* Chapter 26 (the cave) was my favorite chapter out of all the books so far. The imagery was awesome. It reminded me a lot of the Hobbit when Bilbo meets Gollum. 31/2 stars, rounded up to 4. Compared to the last two, it\\'s just seems more... mundane? prosaic? Still really enjoyed it (and was reading it 3 + 4 chapters at a time...) and/but/so brief anecdote: I\\'ve never read this series. My son (currently 51/2 as I write this) received the first book for Christmas 2012. So we\\'ve been reading them aloud together. As of Christmas 2013, we had read the first 3 books, and then he received the entire collection as a gift. So we read book 4. And as his dad I thought to myself: well that got dark in a hurry. And I figured maybe it was too frightening for him, or at least too heavy. But he insisted he could take it. And that he wanted to advance to book 5. So we did, and though it wasn\\'t necessarily darker (because the surprise death of Cedric is still pretty much the pivotal moment in the series, in my opinion), when we reached the end of #5, he told me that it had \"scary parts\" and that he wanted me to read ahead to make sure it wasn\\'t too scary. Anyway, I\\'m glad he did, because there were a few little bits in here that would be tough for him to digest. So there\\'s that. co-dependency might be an unhealthy foundation for a relationship, but if our addictions are complementary, shucks, I\\'ll have no problem spinning this out forever. or, like, irony time? that bag I sold you yesterday was short? what you on, cra... oh wait. right. well, I don\\'t sell slim bags baby. that bag was phat. this bag gonna be even more phat. focus on what you got. oh man, I guess these sorts of drug pictures and references have to end eventually. that and Captain Crunch will get us everything. but, of course I can\\'t help but repeat BFA Bachelor of Fine Arts means addiction equals ability. I really really can spin out 10000 characters a day indefinitely. and wherever it goes, it probably won\\'t end up in a breach, but then maybe it will. unfortunately, since the single applauding audience member is declining to provide direct feedback about the text provided, we\\'re left with the mere repetition of certain tired tropes. as in, \"textual healing,\" \"safe text,\" \"text before marriage,\" \"text in the morning,\" whatever. any halfwit (self) can crack halfjokes all night long. BFA burn baby burn. in all seriousness though, without direct commentary on the subject at hand, the default subject will continue to be the nature of art itself, the secrets of art, the inner world of musicians or whatnot, at least as spied out by a reasonable competent outsider. what this means is the old undergraduate conversation of \"what were we 15000 years ago?\" answer: Tukk, Fjik, Reek, and Jjek-- preverbal, nomadic people who followed buffalo herds and chased mammoths, existing in tribes of about 150 people, no more. hence, our current evolved human mental limit of 150 personalities. now \"the first profession\" is immediately known. the second arrives after some thought. (rot13: rfcvbantr). But what is the third profession of humanity ? answer: S H A M A N! available genetic evidence suggests that between 1-2% of human beings are born as shaman, inclined to wear bird feathers and chant weirdly haunting songs. then, this profession evolved through ancient greece into the dramatic and lyrical arts, the historian (bleh), the musician. and today musicians are still amongst us today, looking at us, checking us out, and discussing us within their own enclosed worlds. I completely stand by my claim that KPP\\'s INVADER carries the subliminal message of INDIE POP; viz., Yasutaka Nakata is deliberately trying to get Tokyo (and other Japanese cities\\') indie pop musicians, mostly early 20 something and at art colleges, on his side. pretty tricky. the relationship in Western settings tends to be, well, more adversarial. in fact, I believe there are currently open law suits regarding the practice of \"sampling,\" which the Supreme Court no less settled in favour of the big name rather than the little guy. this despite the fact that the little guys are like 300 rappers and hip hop artists in the Dirty South or in NYC whose hooks were basically just lifted by a record label rhyming with Mef Kam. how\\'s that for intra-artist battles. this is kind of why the 2013 battle between carpet bombers, goodreaders, the \"management,\" the enforcers, whoever carries a tinge of interest as an object of study itself. I mean, who exactly is battling but a very limited circle of book devotees. the entire \"GR reviewer elite\" is like 200 people. what this results in is what political scientist Samuel Huntington called \"the super-empowered individual.\" the Internet has released certain economies of scale and certain network effects, hence, actually 20 organized GR reviewers actually probably shake things up--- if only for the fact that unity is actually pretty difficult to achieve. Mass sentiment, of course, in the end is in favour of the resistance forces, but there are walls that do not breach easily. they exist. does this make more or less sense without coming off legalistic? I\\'m reading John Grisham right now... thoughts all in legal worlds... but the banking sector recently did me a good turn and fedex\\'d me a replacement card across the Pacific. so it\\'s not always chaos, and it\\'s not always Filipino CSRs answering phones to argue with the Japanese teller girl right in front of your face... KPP in any case, continues to blast from speakers off Center-Gai, and in Shinjuku settings as well. somebody opened the lower drawers at the BOOKOFF (that name is not a typo, nor is their brief corporate cousin, the HARDOFF, *cough*), and aesthetic analysis had to be forced on that issue as well, as Japanese commentary on sandaled feet gave way to the rush of traffic, the speeding kei-trucks, the observation that we might all be getting way too far ahead of ourselves with the references that can\\'t be referenced. and I thought also of the Pennsylvania reviewer with his footnotes: at once a part of the Diaz tradition; at another remove, just part of the whole US thing. but that\\'s the whole problem, right? do we ever know ourselves? I could comment more on aesthetics so I guess I am forced to in a sense. overall people agree that Japanese aesthetics are superior to even many Western cultural models. late 15th century Japanese logos look like modern 2014 variants; there are costumes preserved from 11th century Japanese naval fleets that would not look horrible worn today on a Paris street. in contrast, Sino aesthetics are considered overly cloying, sweet, colorful. yet the SIno response is to claim a deeper Wu/Satori; a greater connection to the Tianxia/Daishi concept. we\\'ll have to leave that for another day. the other flip side of aesthetics, of course, is also, does superior aesthetics compensate for lack of morality? if I viciously beat a hapless 12 year old in the head for the laughs, should I receive a shorter prison sentence if I did so with a giant pink alligator? questions, even entire classroom discussions, can be molded on this topic, but in any case, it is 12:45am in the morning and I don\\'t want the brain to sound too sleep addled. better to jump around and say... C A M D E N T I M E S H A R E!! ha, we can\\'t leave that. suffice to say Etienne has not been around lately but Nadine threw me a possibly passionate look. small girl doesn\\'t care two figs about me, but African boy toy possibly made an ambiguously ambiguous remark. then there\\'s the relatively ineffectual French boys, who are not really participating heavily in social affairs. and that leads, of course, to the repetition of the larger unchallenged point in global settings, English boys are favoured over English girls, but French girls are favoured over French boys. hmm... do the accusations of prejudice fly yet? and if we mind-experimented the idea of a fashionable dinner party with French girls and English girls, are we absolutely absolutely sure the most desirable girl present would be French? Girls Aloud would disagree... I\\'ll go out on a limb though and point out that ROMANCE cultures might be argued as more feminine, evocative, instinctual; GERMANIC cultures more logical, cold, masculine, reserved. we are, unfortunately, GERMAN. we may have been conquered by the Normans in 1066, but that was almost a thousand years ago. Pig and Whistle. Elephant and Castle. because of our own Germanic nature, what we can\\'t realize about ourselves is how oppressive our own existence is to everyone else. that\\'s why I can\\'t complete sympathies for our government\\'s stance in Eastern Europe, where Anglo-Americans and the EU seem to be bandwagoning together... hmm... this is probably a topic for a whole another day, but, hey, Russians can be odd, but some of them can be all right. if that makes me a polar bear, why bark bark bark/ other random animal encounters: cats mostly, some ravens, foot-stomping in Ravenspot. Rvaenspot= hidden double secret location in Yoyogi park, once you find it, you\\'ll know. maybe the precise PSYCHOGEOGRAPHIC centre of the Shinjuku-Shibuya axis. and maybe Harajuku is centre BECAUSE Shimo-kitazawa is to the west, Shin-okubo to the north, Aoyama to the east (fantastic planned architecture), and Meguro to the south. in other words, not just a fashionable neighborhood, but a fashionable series of neighborhoods surrounded each in turn by other fashionable meccas. and yes, I\\'m rambling, but I\\'m rambling if you get what I mean, and psychogeography is oh-so-hot these days isn\\'t it. a science before its time. a French specialty too, I believe. doobie-doobie-doo... feel free to specify what you... [want] in general particularistic terms, the miyashita railway park (a copycat of the high line?) represents a great insider\\'s only access point to Shibuya, and then NHK\\'s location at the top of Yoyogi hill gives it not just a view of Mount Fuji but bragging rights to its central place in J-media. Fuji Television, Asahi TV, these are good competitors, but perhaps only Japan has a BBC equivalent as one of its three major stations, to be torn only by the controversy that its president recently denied wartime atrocities. I actually wonder what the foreign staff think-- grandpa was slain on the Bridge to the River Kwai, but my company\\'s CEO has declared there was no war whatsoever. hmmm. but in one bone to toss to the J-right, I can absolutely declare with absolute certainty that there is no secret Japanese doomsday device located in G-CANS or Mount Fuji. I know dozens of people who would have to be involved were there such a thing; there are, as all fanatics are, completely sane in behaviour and speech. whoa instead of exploring this little chain of thought, I will explore the question of how creating \"artificial break points\" is useful for a healthy progression and relationship with time. if I absolutely declare to myself that I will cut off a relationship with a girl if she does not answer my telephone message within 2 weeks, then even if I crushingly submit to her lack of response and way my behind obediently after the two weeks, at least a mental roadblock has been set up in my decline, right. I think that is part of the way towards making time, the immortal force, at least not totally an enemy. however, I am speaking from the last of \"young adulthood,\" and can\\'t necessarily make broad judgments about life, even if I am your father. I mean, these things aren\\'t always related. instead, my immediate might be to riff a little on why the supposed femininity of French culture versus the supposed masculinity of English/Germanic culture makes the English male / French female relationship ever so more harmonious than the reverse. what is going on is a matching of cultural inclinations, yes? but conversely, the culturally English females who make up 36% of my goodreads friends list will naturally feel averse to hearing in precise detail why the French female is inherently more female than them, well, we are treading some very choppy waters here. [image error] I am very displeased to hear that you believe English females are less feminine than their French counterparts. Expelliarmus! impressions are easy! mimicry is fun! Hermione Granger was not supposed to be too cute, Hollywood lies! in the interests of a general explanation of why I adopt English spellings from time to time, I guess it should also be pointed out that expat life is full of more English and Australians and Commonwealthers in general. yes, the expat bubble, in which we finally understand what we are. but, America, being a continent of some 300 million, does not necessarily need all the international understanding that storm-drenched islands in the north sea require. if England failed to understand the Continent, it would have been overwhelmed. England = Japan in that sense, but also not in another. in any case, we have far exceeded the 10000 character jump point and are not making up the deficit created the last time when a J girl interrupted me, I mean a French girl. I was working for Park Hyatt Shinjuku I mean Kensington Park. I am revealing trade secrets or nothing at all. they tried to send me another letter. fail. it might cause massive offensive if I speculate as to whether Chinese or Japanese girls are more feminine, as this is an examination of whether China or Japan is more feminine. hmmm... I am spinning word balloons aren\\'t I. I am organising marriages. time to say good night, GR. if the point hasn\\'t been repeated enough, I am a four-year trained Bachelor of Fine Arts, and I can word smith 10000 characters a day for two or three years. however, not every country in the world permits access to the Goodreads website. if one of these countries employs me, then this period will also come to an end. so specify the topics you desire, time may not be unlimited This is in my top 3 favorite Harry Potter books, along with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone. Everything really starts to come together in this book, and the ending just took my breath away! I am anxiously awaiting this movie (this fall! )...the trailer I\\'ve seen looks awesome! After Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix kicked off the fight between the Order of the Phoenix and Voldemort\\'s Death Eaters, I couldn\\'t wait to read the continuation. This book successfully builds on the previous Harry Potter books, and fits into the series as the link between the first five books and the last one. J.K. Rowling again includes creatures and magic drawn from ancient cultures and magical legends, and the dialog and drama elevate the book well beyond the level of a traditional children\\'s book. I\\'m so happy to re-read this book. It reminds me why is my favourite <3. ***SPOILER ALERT*** This book was really amazing it even made me cry. Even if I know a lot of spoilers which my friend have told me about Snape being the Half Blood Prince, Snape killed Dumbledore, Ginny and Harry being together, about the horcrux was a fake, my friend actually told me the summary of this book. I think even if I know a lot of what was going to happen I still find it painful to read it especially the part when Dumbledore was killed and Hagrid was talking to Harry and Hagrid doesn\\'t know at that moment that Dumbledore was already dead. It was really painful for me and i cried at that point because it was like suddenly the most person that you think the greatest of them all and actually the one wizard that Voldemort feared was dead. To think that Snape killed him and that the horcrux was fake i feel really terrible that it all ended that way. I think that this ending was more depressing than when Sirius Black was killed on the Order of the Phoenix. There were so many questions that really need answers. That would make you after reading this book think, be nervous about what would possibly happen. I really felt that this was a good book and hope that the movie would not disappoint me. I saw a trailer of it wherein the burrow was burned it\\'s not in the book though. I can\\'t wait to buy \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows.\" Really Harry Potter series made me hooked that i truly recommended everyone to read this book. Much better than the last few books, less angst, phew! June 25th, 2016 - July 5th, 2016 (4.5 stars) Rereading before The Cursed Child comes out. Really enjoyed reading this, I was reminded of the first time I read it. It\\'s kind of frustrating reading it now because I know Draco is going to bring Death Eaters into the castle and Dumbledore will die but I don\\'t ever want it to happen! October 5th, 2014 - October 11th, 2014 (5 stars) A lot fancier than the UK version, I especially like the little touches like the different fonts and Hagrid\\'s tear-stained letter. The pictures were nice though the book is a lot bigger as a result, so not quite so portable - I kept my UK edition in my bag for reading when out and about, and kept the US edition by the bed for reading at home. Had good fun spotting all the differences between the UK edition and this one, things like whiskey, Sorceror\\'s Stone and pants. Would like to get the US editions of the rest of the series. As the release of the seventh book nears, I thought it would be prudent to refresh my memory of the Potter mythos. So I reread Book 6. As I remembered, it was one of the high points of the series--made all the more excellent by the fact that it followed the lackluster fifth book. Harry has overcome most of the childish petulance that both marked and marred his character in Book 5 and Rowling returns to (and further perfects) the formula for adventure that has made the series so popular with readers the world over. As every one of the books feature some authorial missteps, so does the penultimate installment. Still, nothing quite so off-putting as Hermione\\'s house elf activism. The romantic torment and jealousy (the most ill-wrought portion of Book 6) is mild and does not drag out like Harry\\'s attitude did in Book 5 (and in truth, it seemed much longer the first time I read). As well, the chapter leading up to the climax was weakly conceived and was the only point at which I felt the book dragged (both in my first reading and in this re-read). In any case, a well-done book and one that whets well the appetite for the conclusion. p.s. it also had a ton of typos--which seemed strange to me. I remember being surprised to learn that Harry would not be attending Hogwarts for his final year of school, but upon rereading, it\\'s clear that by Book Six, Hogwarts has become little more than a place for Harry to bump into the other characters. The various romantic subplots are perhaps the strongest reminder of the youth of the main characters, and while there are a few Quidditch matches thrown into the mix and occasional offhand references to classes, homework, and studying, it would be relatively easy to transfer the story to another setting altogether. Rowling has almost completely abandoned her formula, but surprisingly, it seems to work. Still, I was disappointed to find that Snape\\'s promotion to teaching Defense against the Dark Arts was only a plot point in so much as it made it possible for Harry to continue potions classes. Harry\\'s conflict with Snape (and, by proxy, his conflict with the legacy of his father), much more so than his conflicts with Draco or Voldemort, has become the most interesting motive force of the plot, and I found myself waiting for Rowling to take advantage of Snape\\'s intrusion into Harry\\'s territory. As for the rest of the book, I found Dumbledore\\'s lessons to be unnecessarily drawn out; Slughorn\\'s memory seemed somewhat less than crucial, since Dumbledore most certainly already knew what a Horcrux was and why Voldemort might want one. At least, however, Rowling relied much less on prolonging the plot by having one character unnecessarily withhold information that would easily resolve everything. This is not my favorite book in the Harry Potter series. (I would be hard pressed to tell you which one is, but I know it\\'s not this one.) Regardless, it\\'s still a wonderful book. We continue on with Harry\\'s tale, fighting evil along the way. As the series goes on the books become a little darker and Harry a little moodier. Some readers may not enjoy this. However, it doesn\\'t bother me much, because it seems true to Harry\\'s character and the things he\\'s going through in his life. Harry\\'s friends, teacher\\'s and classmates are as true to their characters as ever. It\\'s quite a treat to immerse myself into this magical world. There are some romances introduced in this story as well. Nothing gets graphic or anything, but it\\'s a reminder that the characters are growing up and not far from becoming adults. This book has left me quite emotional. There are some BIG events that make readers aware that the end of the story is getting closer all the time. If you\\'re reading this review and haven\\'t tried the Harry Potter series - stop, go get books 1-7, and get started reading! ** spoiler alert ** I can\\'t believe they killed Dumbledore. Annual reread. I love JK, but romance is not her strong point. I think I enjoyed this book most of them all. Rowling\\'s sense of humor never lets the reader down, and her touch with teen emotions is so deft. The old plot veers slightly as Voldemort himself fails to appear--but we learn all about his past as, at last, Dumbledore talks to Harry and answers Questions. There is a surprise at the end that was no surprise to this adult reader, but it certainly was to the kids I taught. It was interesting to see how Rowling set it up, cushioning it, in effect, so the kid reader would see it as inevitable. t was also interesting to see how she set upSnape  as a shadow prince to Harry\\'s Prince. It was obvious to me where this was going to go, but it was interesting watching kids try to guess. Harry\\'s \\'shadow\\' and he are seemingly adversaries, meanwhile the Voldemort threat is kept alive. There are a lot of good world building touches in this book. Though magic still doesn\\'t quite seem to do anything whatever besides provide means for magic wars, the otherworldly touches are fascinating--the phoenix, the centaurs, the mer folk, and of course the various monsters. Characterwise, there are some satisfying pair-ups. Again, I was glad to see far less emphasis on good blood and social status. Fleur, who was so tiresome in the past, gets off one of the best lines in the book. The most intense HP book yet! I love how Harry\\'s become a strong, dark, brave man, yet not an anti-hero. I\\'m pretty sure everyone know that DUMBLEDORE DIES. so no spoiler alert. But what surprised me about the death was not the death ITSELF but the fact that I didn\\'t feel anything. I didn\\'t really care. I sort of read the passage emotionless. The spell and everything. I didn\\'t hate Snape. or Malfoy. or feel what all of the other Hogwarts teachers felt. Not that I felt happy. I just didn\\'t feel anything. And that\\'s when it hit me. J K Rowling\\'s attempt to create a wise and caring mentor for Harry failed. Dumbledore was anything BUT a good mentor. How could he hire Lockhart, Quirrel, fake Moody, and Umrbridge when he had the student\\'s BEST interests at heart? Isn\\'t he supposed to be skilled in Legilimens? Shouldn\\'t he have fought the Ministry\\'s attempt to interfere at Hogwarts? And shouldn\\'t he have prepared Harry better? He doesn\\'t tell Harry ANYTHING about defeating Hogwarts... at the end of every book, he give some lame speech about Harry\\'s bravery and about how LOVE saved him. Only in the sixth book does he attempt to show Harry anything about Voldemort\\'s death... and then he dies. Because he put on the ring because he was tempted by the power or something. He selfishly kills himself when Harry needs him most. When he could have kept Hogwarts safe from Voldemort.. and could have kept Dumbledore\\'s Army safe from the Carrows\\' beatings. So Dumbledore dies. And Harry\\'s left alone to fight Voldemort.. with barely any lead.. or anything to go for. And that\\'s all due to Dumbledore. Is Harry Potter truly the Chosen One? Potter is 16 now, entering his 6th year at Hogwarts, and just a year shy of \"adulthood\" in the wizard world. He\\'s still shaken by the loss he suffered at the end of book 5, but he\\'s been safe at the Dursley\\'s over the holiday break. Still the Dark Lord\\'s forces are gathering strength and there is considerable danger about. This book gives the reader a bit more insight into the life of the boy who became Voldemort. Rowling uses this look at the past to teach an important lesson about how our choices define who we are and what we become. Friendship and loyalty remain a central theme. It\\'s a fast and enjoyable read, and highly recommended for Potter fans. Audio book performed by Jim Dale. Jim Dale\\'s performance of this book is wonderful. His pacing and his facility for different voices lend drama and excitement. His sonorous tones give life to Snape, Dumbledore, Hagrid and Voldemort; and he is still able to give us a hint of youth for Harry and the other young wizards (though he\\'s really not very good at the young women - Hermione, Ginny, Lavender, et al). Where to even begin? I remember when the movie had came out, before I had even started reading the series. See I thought it was just another one of those series that people obsess over and make all these dumb fan clubs. (Which is true but I am now a Potter geek myself.) Anyway...people at school were saying how Dumbledore dies and how he is a great wizard and all that. I forgot what they had said by the time I started reading. It wasn\\'t till I started reading this book when I realizes Dumbledore was the great wizard that was going to die. I hoped it wasn\\'t going to be this book, but I was wrong. I enjoyed Draco growing as a character and not being so....arrogant. Seeing him from going from being so high to having troubles, made him so much more real. Since Dumbledore was teaching Harry about Voldemort\\'s past, I was sure the half-blood prince was him. He was a half -blood as we learned and an heir. Since he always wanted to be special, he called himself a prince. To my great surprise, it was Snape. Then he shocked me even more by killing Snape. Ron and Hermione irritated me to no end. It is clear that they both like each other and I\\'m pretty sure Harry can see that. But why doesn\\'t he help them?? I usually can stand their bickering, but like the entire book, they are ignoring each other. It made my day when Harry got with Ginny. They have some really great chemistry and I hope that doesn\\'t get lost on screen. I understand why he ended it in the end, but I wish he never did that. Good book. The Harry Potter series is definitely a series everyone should read, so if you haven\\'t, go get them! It\\'s a fun and magical read about family, friends, freedom, and a continuous battle between good and evil. J.K. Rowling did a fantastic job with this series! Really bringing it to life and sending a good message to young readers, and even adults. The writing is good, not too detailed though because it is a children\\'s series (though enjoyable for all-ages). The plot throughout the series is well thought out. There are some parts in each book where it gets a little long and dull, but if you push through it it\\'ll go back to being exciting. I thought that the fifth book (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix) was dragged out to the point that is was dull, but all the other books will keep you sucked in until the last page. My favorites out of the series are Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. There are a few swear words throughout the series but nothing too bad and not that many, they show up very rarely (mostly in the beginning books of the series). You really connect with all of the characters, and there are so many that you can relate with one if not more. The creatures in this series are also really cool, dragons, centaurs, mermaids, giants, and more. This series really lets your imagination go wild. http://www.infinitybookreview.blogspo... Probably one of my favorites in the series so far. I absolutely love this series! A little slow moving in the beginning, and certainly depressing, but who can argue with Rowling\\'s incredible plot weavings? 3.5 heartbreaking stars Rowling connects every single detail efficiently..I can\\'t quite nail the pattern of Rowling\\'s writing.. Surprises in every single book.. Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle\\'s reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, \\'Tom\\'? First two books were relaxed, in the third, the story was heating up, voldemort rose in fourth, Harry\\'s true first fight in fifth, preparation for second battle in sixth..(like being familiar with voldemort ..knowing his weak points...) And the final and second battle in seventh..(as in revelations in Bible, the second coming or the final battle..) Rowling has planned it well.. Though I understand it limitedly.. A few thoughts: In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination. Oblivious reasons are sometimes scarier then obvious ones.. That\\'s not unicorn hair, Hagrid? \"Oh, yeah,\" said Hagrid indifferently. Gets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches an\\' stuff in the forest, yeh know ... But my dear chap, do you know how much that\\'s worth? \"I use it fer bindin\\' on bandages an stuff if a creature gets in jured,\" said Hagrid, shrugging. \"It\\'s dead useful. very strong.\" Happened after Aragog\\'s burial.. This is why I love hagrid\\'s character.. Been laughing all the way through Aragog\\'s burial! sang Slughorn plaintively. \"They laid him to rest with his hat inside out. And his wand snapped in two, which was sad.\" terrible,\" Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply. This is my favorite portion in this book..DSO FUNNY!! \"You\\'d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,\" said Harry. It would be a very brave and noble thing to do. Some things happen and you just have to wait and take it slow to undo the misshapen or strengthen the good. am afraid,\\' she went on, \\'that the nag - I\\'m sorry, the centaur - knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him - one Seer to another - had he not, too, sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!\\' I wish there was professor trelawny and firenzes conversation in the book..I loved those very much! Your blood is worth more than mine. How humble of Dumbledore.. Wish I could be as humble and caring as dumbledore. Selfless,all the way.. \\'Yeah, that fits,\\' said Harry. \\'He\\'d play up the pureblood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them ... he\\'s just like Voldemort. Pureblood mother, Muggie father ... ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name - Lard Voldemort - the HalfBlood Prince - how could Dumbledore have missed -?\\' The most vital portion which led to the heading of the book. This was amazing! Phenomenal! The ending really broke my heart. Can\\'t wait to read the next one!! i wish i could rate it more than just five out of five... i saw this somewhere... \"That moment when you finish a book, look around, and realize that everyone is just carrying on with their lives as though you didn\\'t just experience emotional trauma at the hands of a paperback.\" And this makes so much sense right now... OK. I\\'m prepared to admit I\\'ve read it. As someone once said about Jeffrey Archer novels, it\\'s rather like a packet of stale chips. You keep taking them out and eating them, hoping that the ones at the bottom are little better. But they\\'re not. After a while, you notice that the bag is empty, and you feel rather disgusted with yourself. She claims the whole story was planned from the beginning. Yeah, right. Though, to be fair, she\\'s in good company; Proust said something similar about A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu. He didn\\'t come across as very credible either. If you still don\\'t believe me about the links between Proust and Potter, look here. If that doesn\\'t convince you, I give up. There\\'s such a thing as being too sceptical for your own good. Wow. It was worth growing up to appreciate this book fully. Slughorn is amazing, Harry (aka Roonil Wazlib) is amazing and Dumbledore is... sob, sob. I wonder if Lily Evans was so great at potions because Severus was and he let her cheat, or if they shared this passion. WHYYYY? I was using this to de-stress between exams and you had to do this to me. I\\'m more stressed than I was before, how could you, J.K.Rowling? t was so unexpected and I hate Snape so much right now  even though I\\'m pretty sure the next book will redeem him   and I\\'m so sorry for Draco, he\\'s too young for this awful shit. And my boy, Harry James Potter was so determined at the end of the book, I could hear bad-ass songs accompanying him as he walked. ut really why did she kill Dumbledore? hy does she have to kill every father figure Harry ever has? et the boy be happy for once. nd that thing with Ginny, yikes. y girl Ginny can totally take care of herself, doesn\\'t need you to break up with her, Harry Pottahhhh. One of the best of the series behind Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows. Excellent, unpredictable, and very well done. Great character development. Interesting view into Voldemort. Loved this book and love reading it again and again! Can you marry a book? Because I want to marry this one! The three stages of reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince : 1)Laugh so hard I couldn\\'t breath 2) Read maniacally 3) Ugly cry and feelings that life is over My current state: I AM AFRAID FOR EVERYONE\\'S FUTURE RIGHT NOW! (Spoiler alert!) So I don\\'t really understand this, but the first couple of times I read this, I didn\\'t cry at all when Dumbledore died. The first time I was shocked and saddened, but, very strangely for me, didn\\'t cry. But now that I\\'ve read the 7th book and know that he was going to die anyways, I\\'ve been bawling. Strange, yes? This one is actually happy -I mean, besides the annual big-huge-fight- and that\\'s very nice, especially since the 7th book is so...dreary, shall we say? There are parts that are...not exactly scary, more like very tense. And they make me shiver even though its 75 degrees outside: specifically, the chapter \"The Cave\". Also, Harry and Ginny! So cute! This is when Rowling really focused on the finish. No more f-ing around. This woman had a job to do. In a way, I was glad the sports championships, tournaments and other silly asides were done with. On the other hand, the story became singleminded in scope. As readers we were no longer inhabiting the world of Harry Potter, we were now on a quest. As much as I\\'ve complained about those silly asides, I realized after finishing this book (and especially after the next one) that I missed them. Diversions done well are a nice relief and can add so much depth to story and character. If there is something to be said about the story and character of Harry Potter, it\\'s that our boy is all growed up. Book #6 is a far cry from #1. A big and important step is taken in the The Half-Blood Prince. Rowling shows she is not afraid to kill off her most precious babies. Some would say the series had to end at some point and that the killings were not so bold. Ah, but many a publishing and movie executive would disagree and cry out, \"Why?! Why kill the cash cow?!?!\" Well, she did. Finally Rowling did kill it. She brought this whole satisfying series to an end, and this is its beginning. For the love of Christ, we\\'re almost done reading these to our kids. This one was actually much better than it\\'s crappy predecessor. Some cool revelations about the big baddie and some sweet-ass wizard battles. Plus, Snape! Rowling wasn\\'t afraid to kill off main characters, either, though it was unavoidable and kind of predictable mostly because other kids keep ruining the story for us. On the negative side, the pacing is off, all the interesting characters are completely left out and even Ron and Hermione just sort of simper around whining a lot. I\\'d Crucio those two into oblivion. Gradually, I think these books got worse and worse. I felt like Rowling lost track of her own characters. EDIT: Upon actually reading the book again, and finishing it all the way this time, I can say that I really didn\\'t mind it. Although I still don\\'t care much for the way Rowling\\'s characters began to act, I did enjoy this book. I feel betrayed!!! This will no doubt be the root of all my trust issues... ** spoiler alert ** One of my top 3 Harry Potter books, but I cried when Dumbledore died. Poor thing. Second read: Still fantastic, obviously. The plot is pretty long and drawn out with nothing happening for a while but Rowling JUST picks it up in exactly the right spot before it begins to get boring. Her brilliance in writing really shows how she can carry 500+ pages with very little excitement and still make it a page turner. The ending really makes the book where all the hints and mysteries comes together in such a perfect way where so many characters change and so much happens, I felt like I read the last 100 pages in five minutes I just couldn\\'t stop. First read: Another fantastic addition in the HP series. Unbridled intensity, plot developments galore, brilliant characters and dialogue, strange and amazing environments...all standard HP brilliance. This book, however, did suffer from just too much shallow teen romance, re-hashing the same stereotypical gendered bullshit of boys being dumb and girls crying all the time that never happens in real life. There was too much dating early and mid book and it just seemed like filler. I understand it fits in their development as teenagers...but it could have been done a lot better. Other than that the book was great and, obviously, a great addition to the series. MY FAVORITE FROM THE WHOLE SERIES. DRACO IS AMAZING OK. 11/10/10 - This one is so heavy, that I quite appreciated the light-heartedness of the hormone stuff. I like how the lovey-dovey stuff is kinda slowly been building up. I adore Ron and Hermione together. I like Ginny and Harry together. I loved the scene at the end with Fleur in the hospital wing. I loved Luna and I want to hear more about Neville. I find at the end of this one, I don\\'t have a whole lot to say about it. I liked it of course, but mostly I\\'m just anxious to get to the last one. I\\'ve only read it once and honestly, I kinda rushed through it. 12/26/12 - This was my first read-aloud of this book. I don\\'t remember if the end choked me up this much before, but it definitely did this time. I had a hard time getting through it! My Little was a little sad at the top of the astronomy tower too, but the aftermath didn\\'t seem to bother her as much. We immediately started Deathly Hallows. 7/8/16 - Still loved it. Dumbledore died. :( Out of the characters he was one of my favorites. If he hadn\\'t died I might have added another star to my rating. I really don\\'t enjoy this series though I still carried on reading it anyway, it\\'s a well written book there\\'s nothing wrong with it in that respect, it\\'s just it\\'s not the book for me. Sorry only 1 star off me. I\\'m so miserable right now, I have been crying for fifteen minutes, and I feel like a little kid who has just grown up all at once. I love these books more than words can express. Christmas break is the perfect time to read this sort of thing (especially since I also had to re-read the fifth book to refresh my memory). These terrible obsessions can\\'t possibly be quenched somewhat and then put to rest during regular working days, oh no. Holidays are the only time for it, and only if you don\\'t have much else planned. This is by far my favourite harry potter book! I love it way too much! I\\'ve cried so hard! ombuldore dying just broke my heart A lot happen in this book, new amazing spells like Sectunsempra just for enemies and more! Now, after Ive read this book again, now that Im twenty years old I just feel pity for Draco, I think all he\\'s ever done it\\'s to make his father proud but Lucious is just a snake sun of a bitch who desn\\'t give a fuck for his son. Because if I was him, I would hide my son from the shadow of the dark one. bout Snape,  I know how this ends! ut I can\\'t help myself from hating him in this book. I liked this because of Snape and all those realizations XD Gosh it\\'s been a long time I really enjoyed this book compared to book five in the series. I think it mainly had to do with the fact that Harry wasn\\'t being a jerk to his friends anymore, Dumbledore was an active part of his life again, Ron and Hermoine started to show their feelings for each other, and Ginny and Harry finally hooked up (as well as Tonks and Lupin) There was a lot of love and action in this book to keep the pages turning. It was also very interesting to see Voldemort more as a person in the memories than a snake-like creature-man. Kind of humanized him a bit so it feels like Harry has a chance. I remember crying my eyes out the first time I read it when Dumbledore died, but I think with how many times I\\'ve seen the movie and knew it was coming, I didn\\'t get as emotional. This is probably my favorite Harry Potter books so far, aside from the first one. I liked it, but it wasn\\'t as exiting as the others. My least favorite of the series. RE-READ: Half-Blood Prince was not my favorite book when I first read it in high school, but as a shiny thirty-something adult, I feel like I appreciated it more this time. I still love Draco\\'s arc and the connection he builds with Moaning Myrtle. I love the information we get about Tom Riddle and how he came to be the villain he is. I loved seeing more of Dumbledore and Harry. I loved that Grawp was at Dumbledore\\'s funeral in a close approximation of a suit. I love how we finally got Remus and Tonks, which was a pairing I didn\\'t even know I wanted until it happened. I even love the silliness and the evolution of teenage love/relationships (Ron/Lavender, the disaster that was Hermione/Cormac, and Harry/Ginny.) Inferi are creepy and terrifying. Fenrir Greyback is creepy and terrifying. Dumbledore\\'s death still crushes me every time. WAAAH. Six down, one to go. Maybe I can accomplish the goal of finishing them all before the end of this year? I like this one a lot, nearly as much as OOtP. I do like that she allowed them one last moment of relative levity before the final fight. However, the Harry/Ginny romancin\\' leaves me a little cold, simply because she\\'s been such a bit part up until about half-way through this book. I like her - a lot - and I get why Harry would too. However, she\\'s not been on-screen enough for me to form an actual attachment to, and so it seems somewhat rushed. But it\\'s not a huge complaint! Depressing but great. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was amazing! J.K. Rowling is such a talented author! She breathes new light onto both Voldemort and Snape and you learn more about them (more about Voldemort than Snape). The love stories in this book were definately a nice addition in the more serious atmosphere. Ron was, as always, the comical relief. I really enjoyed seeing Fred and George\\'s shop. That was a great detail to the series that I think every reader was definately waiting for. Everything with Voldemort gets more complicated as you read this book though. Interesting but complicated. It\\'s a good complicated though. You can still understand everything but the world of Harry Potter is definately well-thought out. I LOVED this book. I bought it as soon as it came out and read it all in one day/night. Luckily I didn\\'t have to work the next day.  was soo upset that Dumbledore died. ut like most people I knew there had to be a reason why Snape killed him.  just couldn\\'t accept that Snape was a traitor. Snape. Snape. Severus Snape. Master at potions? Harry?? Okay. He finds a book filled with different directions and new spells. This helps him become a favorite of the new Potions teacher. Of course, Hermione is jealous. Ron is his usual mad self. It is another adventure at Hogwarts. Be prepared for some tears. ** spoiler alert ** Dumbledore\\'s death was very obvious with the amount of time Rowling took in this book to humanize him. Though Snape being the Half-Blood Prince was a surprise; I thought it would be Voldemort even though I thought it odd that he would proudly call himself a half-blood. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. I find it difficult to give a critical review on a series of books that is so ingrained into my young life that if I had not read these books, I would honestly not be who I am today. I have read this book 5-7 times now and it will be a book I go back to again and again over the years of my life. I will always love Harry and his friends. I love all the Harry Potter books. It is a bad idea to read the last part of this book when you\\'re feeling down. Like, seriously, it is a very bad idea, even if you know what\\'s gonna happen. I read this thing non-stop until I finished it. A lot of filler with a killer ending, Half-Blood Prince is a perfectly okay instalment in the Harry Potter series. In the wake of the villainous Lord Voldemort\\'s return to power, 16 year-old Harry returns to wizard school, studies Voldemort\\'s past, suspects a peer of plotting evil, and engages in the usual amount of magical shenanigans. This is the first book where Voldemort\\'s evil intentions are out in the open, the wizarding community is actively bracing for war, and Harry understands his role as the only one capable of defeating Voldemort. Though Harry story is still confined to his boarding school, in this book we finally get a sense of what is really at stake in the battle against Voldemort. Half-Blood Prince includes a decent amount of school magic fun and plenty of humorous teen romance, though the book doesn\\'t exactly have a driving, complex plot. Apart from a couple of isolated, ineffective attacks, there isn\\'t much menace behind the antagonist\\'s plot. Most of the tension comes from the characters hearing about a growing stream of deaths and disappearances via the newspaper. Even the Half-Blood Prince plot (which ought to be of vital importance, considering that it is in the title) turns out to be not all that relevant to the overall story. Nonetheless, it\\'s enjoyable when Harry deviously succeeds in Potions class by following the Half-Blood Prince\\'s handwritten instructions in an old textbook, and disturbing when the Prince entices Harry into using a dark curse. Another of my favourite sequences is when Harry uses a luck potion to convince one of his professors to divulge a shameful memory. However, like all the longer Harry Potter books there\\'s a fair amount of padding. Some of the padding comes from needless repetitions. For example, Harry notices his arch rival Draco Malfoy acting suspiciously in a Darks Arts shop and theorises Draco has become initiated as one of Voldemort\\'s followers. He relays his suspicions to everyone who will listen in many separate scenes - though no one believes him. These repetitive discussions add nothing new to Harry\\'s theory, they aren\\'t plot progression, they\\'re redundant. The same thing happens when Harry suspects his teacher Professor Snape of aiding Draco - Harry once again repeats his suspicions to multiple people in separate scenes, convinces no one and generally just wastes his (and the reader\\'s) time. Harry\\'s prolonged investigation into Draco Malfoy\\'s activities is composed of endless, failed attempts that make Harry look incredibly incompetent. In the earlier books Harry was quite clever and capable, but he seems to get progressively more inept with each book. His ineptitude successfully stretches out the weak central plot to the required length, but at the expense of transforming the main character into a total ignoramus. Another source of padding involves the usual assortment of subplots which vary immensely in how interesting they are. I personally found the Quidditch subplot to be tiresome and honestly wish J.K. Rowling had retired the sport a couple of books ago. Rowling does her best to make it fresh and different, but never fully succeeds. Your mileage will vary, but I was equally underwhelmed by subplots like Tonk\\'s deflated mood and Professor Snape\\'s transfer out of the Potions classroom. Some padding comes from Rowling surrounding interesting moments with too much extraneous filler. For example, when Dumbledore first takes Harry into a memory to study Voldemort\\'s past, we spend several pages following the completely random character Bob Ogden before getting to the point. Actually, we don\\'t ever really get to the point because although the mildly interesting memory shows Voldemort\\'s family in an unexpected light, it doesn\\'t exactly contain any super-crucial information. Dumbledore could easily convey his theory about Voldemort much more succinctly instead of drawing it out all year via lengthy trips down memory lane. Having written all this, the final chapters of this book work wonderfully as fantasy spectacle and action scene. The final confrontation also advances the series\\' overall conflict and changes everything going into the final instalment. So it\\'s all incredibly frustrating when Harry and Dumbledore\\'s efforts are revealed to have been for nothing. At the end of the day, I think Half-Blood Prince is moderately enjoyable, but unfortunately overlong, repetitive and ultimately futile. This is a great series. It\\'s one that I (like everyone else) fell in love with. I will admit there are all sorts of problems with plot holes, limited character development, and the like, but this world is enchanting and captivating. It sucks you in and you find you don\\'t care about all those details. I had a slow start with this book because I went on vacation and couldn\\'t take it with me. I think so far this has been the saddest book for me but at the same time it\\'s incredibly revealing. Now I can\\'t wait to read the last one. I was a sobbing mess at the end of this one. Stop looking at reviews and read this series. Seriously, what are you still doing here? Read it! Unlike earlier books in the series, which I\\'ve re-read many times (I used to re-read them while waiting for the later books to come out), this was the first time I\\'d revisited Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince since I finished the series. It\\'s a very different experience, reading this book now that I know how the whole epic conflict with Voldemort works out, than my relatively-unspoiled first reading. (At the time, there were rumors that a major character died; I had my theories but scrupulously avoided any media where spoilers might lurk, and I read the whole book in two days on the day of release, so I got to enjoy, er, experience the surprise.) This second time through, knowing what\\'s coming, it strikes me that Book Six is actually very bittersweet. Half-Blood Prince isn\\'t as dark and brooding as the preceding book, Order of the Phoenix. Now that Dolores Umbridge is gone, Hogwarts is a bright, happy place again. Now that the O.W.Ls (standardized testing for wizard students) is behind them, Harry and his friends seem to enjoy their classes more; they are less pressured, more leisurely. They find time for romance, for quidditch, for weekends in Hogsmeade, for learning how to apparate. Harry, who was furious at being ignored by Dumbledore in Order of the Phoenix, is back on good terms with the headmaster again: he\\'s even singled out for special one-on-one lessons aimed to help him defeat Voldemort when the time comes. Book Six is the calm before the storm. Outside of Hogwarts, terrible things are happening now that Voldemort is back -- the Daily Prophet is always full of stories of kidnappings, murders, and other tragedies that show the Dark Lord is gaining ground -- and Harry and the others are aware of these miseries but insulated from them. In these dark times more than every before, Hogwarts is a haven, a refuge, a bubble. Dumbledore is the only wizard Voldemort fears, and so Dumbledore\\'s school is the safest place to be. nowing now that this is Harry\\'s last year at Hogwarts (rather than the anticipated 7th year), I think it\\'s kind of lovely that it was generally such a nice one: that he got to be the Quidditch team captain, that he finally had a potions teacher he could stand, that Gryffindor won the Quidditch cup, and Harry and Ginny got to enjoy a few weeks of happiness. Of course that idyllic calm can\\'t last, and the conclusion is meant to set up the final book, Deathly Hallows. While it\\'s not a cliffhanger in the traditional sense, the end of Half-Blood Prince leaves a lot more open questions than the relatively self-contained plot of the other books in the series. Again, knowing what is coming changed my perspective on the ending. The first time I read it, I was stunned and horrified, ot only by Dumbledore\\'s death but also by Snape\\'s apparent betrayal, but this time, I approached the final chapters with a strong sense of inevitability. Random Spoilery Thought: s I\\'ve been making my way through Litchick\\'s Epic Harry Potter Group Read (which has now been going on since before Thanksgiving), I\\'ve been thinking all along that Snape is so horrible, more horrible than I remembered, so horrible that the big reveal at the end of Deathly Hallows falls flat because it isn\\'t enough to redeem such a nasty character.  still kind of feel that way, but in retrospect I think the part of Half-Blood Prince where Snape gives Harry Saturday detentions after Harry and Malfoy duel is a bit of a give-away. etention is a really lenient punishment for almost murdering someone, and I should have been much more suspicious of that at the time. If you haven\\'t read this book, don\\'t even attempt to read this review. Honestly, you\\'re just going to regret doing so. It\\'s been two years since I read this for the first time. Yes, two years separated tte moment in which I finished book 5 and started book 6. Now, don\\'t ask me why because I don\\'t know. This is a book I particularly like. Well, duh, I like all the HP books, but I mean this is one of my favourite HP books. The reasons are plenty, so I will mention only one: Tom Riddle, or as we knew him from the beginning of this series, Lord Voldemort. From the moment I knew he was Harry\\'s enemy and the one who murdered his parents, a certain curiosity to know why he had done that and to know more about his past was born, yet we didn\\'t fully understand him till this book, in which he was finally given a backstory. And what a backstory it was. One would be even more afraid of him after getting to know bits of his past, and indeed, I was, but I was more intrigued by his character than afraid of him. As for the... death in this book (you know which one I\\'m talking about)... I don\\'t know if it\\'s the same for you as it is with me, but I found it more shocking than sad. I think that\\'s because of all the things happeing around. There were so many surprises revealed, and the book only got more and more intense. But of course, Dumbledore isn\\'t really gone if there are still loyal people to him, isn\\'t that true? What I sure will miss are his words of wisdom, some of which I carry with me as if they were a treasure, like this one I took from this book: It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. And with reason I did. I mean, how true is that? Now I will reread the last book. I know what expects me is lots of darkness, death, and even more surprised than the ones revealed previously in the series. I am not prepared, but I will continue as Harry did with the task of the Horcruxes. Bought for Myself Overall Rating: 5.00 + Series Rating: 5.00 + NOTE: June 26, 2011 marks my \"Gosh I don\\'t know how many times I have read this book\" annual Re-Read! I will be changing all my ratings of this series to 5 because I have come to the conclusion that if I can re-read them this many times they are worthy of a 5! What I Loved: This book I think is the one Harry finally starts to grow up a little though he is still way to angry for my taste. It has been a long time since I was 16 so maybe that is normal with all the loss that he has had in his life. I loved how they kind of split up the team for a bit so they could understand how important they were to each other. Also, I like the blossoming of young love that happened in this book because if you aren\\'t fighting for love and hope then what is the point. Loved the Weasley twins as always! They are the right amount of lightness that is needed in dark times! Just my thoughts: This isn\\'t my favorite book in the series--never has been. To be honest, there are times when I think Malfoy is growing up more than Harry. I don\\'t like Malfoy but his journey has kind of been the flip side of Harry\\'s all along. Ron and Hermoine again to me are the best friends anyone can have. They put up with so much from Harry and until the very last of the book I don\\'t think he realizes how lucky he really is. Why I gave it a 5+: After re-reading this book so many times, I have decided that all the growing pains were necessary to lead up to the last book in the series. The stuff I didn\\'t like had to do mostly with Harry---his anger, especially after the last book, really kind of didn\\'t work for me. Also, don\\'t like how he constantly questions Dumbledors thoughts on Snape. Still a really great book though. What I read/listened to this time around (I usually do a listen/read combo--sometimes not): 2009: HC US 2010: HC US 2011: HC US/Audiobook US 2012: HC US/Audiobook US 2013: Ebook US/Audiobook US 07/16/2013 2014: Ebook US/Audiobook UK Jun 27, 2014 2015: Ebook UK 2016: Ebook UK/Hardcover UK/Audiobook UK 2017: Ebook UK/Audibook UK Love it! i enjoyed reading this book. i was thrilled all throughout the book. Actual rating: 4.5 Damn, Harry Potter is getting darker and has more romance in each book progressively... This one\\'s kinda creepy though and saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad, cause spoilers ;) I didn\\'t much care for this one most of the way through. Thought it had a really slow start. Now, I see that\\'s because it\\'s a definite precursor for the last one. First of the HP books to end on a cliffhanger. The last 250 pages or so were spectacular. Kept me up reading until 4:30 in the morning. Positively brilliant stuff. Why, oh why? I can\\'t stop crying! I should give this book one star because of my broken heart. This is by far my favorite Harry Potter book. The whole series is phenomenal, OBVIOUSLY, but this book was my absolute favorite to read. I\\'m looking forward to rereading it honestly! It was heartbreaking and thrilling at the same time.. My favorite book among the Harry Potter Series (I think). I was VERY surprised when I read it the first time. Never imagined Harry ending up with Ginny. But it\\'s an amazing book overall. Source: I own multiple copies of this book. Cost: Unknown Title:  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Series:  Harry Potter #6 Author:  JK Rowling Overall Rating:  5 stars I am not okay. This book genuinely has broken my heart, I can tell where the saddest parts are in my copy as the pages are literally tear stained. Growing up, I read and re-read this whole series multiple times, and I can literally tell you every detail in every book, but every single time, it breaks my heart. I\\'m not okay with this series, especially being slightly sleep deprived as I read this book. I think this book makes you feel kind of okay despite how sad the world around it is, there is an undercurrent of sadness and grimness, but there is also humour and a glimmer of hope and it kind of makes you feel like everything will be okay then WHAM. The thing that shall not be named happens. Which wasn\\'t very nice JK. Thank you. word count: 168,923 rating: far better than I remember I\\'ve re-read most of Harry Potter books several times, but the last two... Well, they were much darker and I\\'m squeamish, especially when it comes to things I\\'m so emotionally invested in. So when I picked up the 6th book I wasn\\'t so sure I want to read it at all. Boy, was I wrong. It was good. Very good. Rowling got quite excellent in writing throughout the years. Those logical mistakes we find in the first books are gradually fewer and fewer until we end up with a book that at first sight doesn\\'t bother us at all (yes, if you\\'re mean you can find something to complain about, that\\'s always possible, but that doesn\\'t mean much). About the tone: It\\'s been gradually changing. In the fifth book we get a mix of focus on school and Voldemort with a big, dark \\'umph\\' at the end which tells us all bets are off. In the Half Blood Prince lessons and school stuff we grew to love are clearly secondary; we said good bye to them when Fred and George left the school (at least that\\'s how I feel). Now our characters are still at Hogwarts, but lessons, quidditch games and feasts are barely mentioned in the passing - they\\'re not the point. That shift is very clear. Now Harry is preparing for the grand finale. Is that a good thing? Yes, it\\'s great for the whole story, even if it\\'s less \\'fun\\'. You\\'ve got to understand that I\\'ve read all of it before, so there was no sense of novelty to things Harry finds out. Less stress, but also less excitement. But the first time I read it... it was nerve-racking. Harry is a bit more grown up; he\\'s still prone to some teen behaviours, but far, far less than in the Order of the Phoenix. Characters are developing and getting more and more multidimensional (Dumbledore, Herione, Ron... everyone, even those on the side of evil, like the Malfoys). I love that growing complexity. That things aren\\'t black and white, simple. In LOTR you have orcs, creatures utterly dispensable, there\\'s no gravitas to killing them. It\\'s a no-brainer. In HP we\\'re dealing with people, and people are much more complex. Value of life is much more difficult to estimate. People aren\\'t simply divided into good and bad, there\\'s so much more to the way they choose to act! And Rowling is brilliant in showing it. Actually, Rowling is brilliant. Period. The effortless way in which she conveys thing deserves the highest respect. There\\'s so much \\'showing\\' other authors should freaking study her writing. I didn\\'t notice it at first, it just happens, it took some conscious effort on my side to see it. That\\'s how engrossed you are in the story. I love it. I love the ending, I love reaction of members of the Order of the Phoenix to the news, I love Luna and Neville (Rowling introduces so many different types of people with varying qualities that are worth respect! ), I love the Ron-Hermione relationship that starts changing, I love how dangerous using spells you don\\'t really know is, how dangers of magic are presented. I love the teachers, the students, the ministry of magic (cause aren\\'t all the politicians speckled with various stinky, shitty things? ), I love how cold and calm becomes Harry\\'s reaction to it... I love a lot of things I\\'m unable to name at this time. Including the action scenes! It would be so easy to fuck up the fights, and yet they are dynamic and exciting. Wow. Just wow. Re-reading that book helped me admire Rowling even more. I am not okay. (Also, WHERE THE HECK IS NEVILLE.) Review of entire series to follow on my blog (once I finish the series, that is). I enjoyed this even more on the re-read. In some ways it is a break from all the dark stuff, but it still permeates the book. The ending is terribly sad too. I think the invention of Felix Felicis is really great - I love how that all plays out. This series only gets better as you reread it, honestly. LOVED IT, CRIED OVER IT, LAUGHED OVER IT, AND HUGGED IT! THE FEELS HAVE BEEN PRETTY STRONG IN THIS ONE AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WILL HAPPEN (EVEN IF I KNOW SOME SPOILERS) IN THE LAST BOOK- HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS. I first read this when I was a child, and the whole series is a definite 5 for me. I grew up with this. Heck, my parents loved it so much we used to watch the movies together. It just gets darker and darker... And this book is the beginning of the end! What a mystery. Love you Queen Rowling xo I can\\'t even begin to review this book except to say it doesn\\'t matter how much I know, it\\'s always a devastating read. There are always tears. Awesome...and I think I shed a few tears at the end. Poor Dumbledore. Third time through and I still cried at the end. And enjoyed the whole thing no end (except for the Ron and Hermione arc - but it works for the age group for which it is intended). Although I am pleased that the time with the Dursleys has been cut drastically short in the later books, it seems to have been replaced by Harry\\'s bad-temper at being misunderstood and insistence on investigating problems that no one else agrees is a problem. That is not to say that he might not be right, but the persistence of the bad-temper and \"misunderstood\" attitude puts me distinctly in sympathy with Sirus Black\\'s ancestor\\'s portrait in the last book when he acidly pointed out how those attitudes are common and boring in the young. That aside, I\\'m enjoying this book just as much as the others ... at about chapter 10. As always, I\\'m still amazed at how little I remember of the plot, whether small points or large ... UPDATE Ok, seriously. I\\'m on chapter 26, on the trail of the horucrux with Harry and Dumbledore. How can I NOT remember one thing about this? On the other hand, I can testify that it is a very suspenseful book, well written ... and one I can\\'t stop listening to... FINAL - SPOILERS INCLUDED *sniffle* Ok, I have finished. id remember that Dumbledore died.  did remember that somehow the book ended with all fans violently arguing about whether Snape was good or evil ... and that I adamantly maintained that Dumbledore was asking Snape to kill him, which Snape didn\\'t want to do. I think the reason I tended to forget the end of this book was that I got this battle confused with the bigger battle at the end of The Deathly Hallows. Well only time will tell that, as I have requested the audio version of Deathly Hallows but am waiting in line. The last movie must have made many more people than me revisit the audio versions. What a wonderful, satisfying book. Very dark, of course, but it would have to be because Harry must be left with nothing between him and Voldemort for the final reckoning. And that can\\'t happen without losing loved ones along the way. At least not in classic stories it can\\'t. Actual Rating: 3.5 Stars It seems I can\\'t seem to love these books as much as I want to. It was a good book - very well thought out and executed, yet it wasn\\'t enough for me to call it exceptional. I think with this book, it was more of a personal problem for me. I love romance books - don\\'t get me wrong - but this one tested my limits. I can handle a MAX of 2 relationships at one time (and I\\'d prefer only one of them to be a major plot point). There was just too much sexual tension and angst for me. e had Bill and Fleur in the beginning, and they were fine. on and Hermoine have their big over-arching romance going on this entire series.  loved the lead up to it from all the previous books, with the little moments of jealousy and protectiveness. owever, their relationship in this book had too much tension, drama, and pettiness to be enjoyable for me.  feel like Harry and Ginny\\'s relationship didn\\'t have enough lead-up towards it - at least from Harry\\'s perspective. t was basically Harry asking Ginny to join him/Ron and Hermoine a couple times and feeling disappointed when he was rejected (because of Dean). nd then there was one moment of contact where he had butterfly-like feelings. his all would be fine if Ginny was some random girl, but Ginny is a friend - someone Harry has known for a long time. t would have been nice to have the transition from friendship to relationship fleshed out a little more. t was just too immediate. nd then the ending where Harry was like: \"We can\\'t be together. t\\'s too dangerous.\" Eye roll.  Could that be anymore cliche and annoying?  didn\\'t see him tell Ron and Hermoine that they had to stop being friends. gh. nd then there\\'s Tonks and Lupin. his one was just randomly thrown in there. All these relationships would have been fine if they weren\\'t all thrown in/peaking in the same book. It was too much for one book, in my opinion, and would have been better if they were spread out over the series. In fact, I was talking about the horcruxes with a friend while reading this, wondering what they were. I was over half-way through the book, so she was surprised that they weren\\'t explained already and asked me: What has been going on in the book then? The answer: Nothing. Just relationship drama. The actual plot was basically at a stand still for the first half of the book. That being said, the second half of the book was great. The idea of horcruxes is seriously cool, and it\\'s pretty awesome seeing Tom Riddle\\'s story. In this book, we got to see Dumbledore in a more human light - not just the great, untouchable wizard. He was funny and quirky and simply a delight. His adventure with Harry was super fun. And by fun, I mean creepy. And then...THE ENDING. HOLY CRAP. THAT PLOT TWIST. aving lived for 18 years without reading the series, things are bound to get spoiled. o unfortunately, I already know that Snape turns out to be a good guy. t kind of sucks, but I\\'m still excited to see the reasoning behind his actions. nd I definitely did NOT expect Snape to be the one to kill Dumbledore. Ahh. The ending was just so action packed and climatic. Just awesome. Totally left me pumped for the finale. Half-Blood Prince is arguably one of the best entries of this series. The best thing about it that I love is the insight in Tom Riddle\\'s past. It was dark stuff and it personified Voldemort instead of just keeping him a generic evil guy. There was a lot of little stuff that I didn\\'t remember reading before, which made me really glad that I chose to reread these books. On to the last one now. You\\'ll never be gone as long as we\\'re here. Read my review of the entire series here. t\\'s even sadder when you read it without the knowledge that Dumbledore\\'s death was planned the whole time , which was how the readers inevitably read it, barring any inconvenient spoilers. Very sad. This one was great, a different feel on the whole than the other books. I felt like this one was geared more toward girls because of the relationships. This one felt like more of a page turner than the first 5. Rating: 5 stars. I really liked this book too. It\\'s my second favorite of the series. Rowling kept me flipping pages through the entire novel. My favourite of the series, for many many reasons, not just because I\\'m a ginormous Draco fan. It\\'s difficult to write a review for this book. The first three-quarters of the book could be renamed \"Harry Potter and Normal Life Inside of Hogwarts.\" Without something like the opening of the Chamber of Secrets or the TriWizard Tournament to give the plot a driving force, we spend a lot of time with Harry, Ron and Hermione in class, figuring out their love lives and worrying about Voldemort -- but in way that\\'s not immediate or dangerous. But the ending! Oh, the ending! ...and I\\'m not so much of a jerk to spoil the ending at all. In this book, Harry is finally leaving boyhood behind and becoming a man. It\\'s uncomfortable for him and sometimes uncomfortable for the readers. His friends aren\\'t following him blindly any more, intent on being equals and not merely sidekicks. Everyone makes ridiculously stupid decisions and act like jerks about it. But it\\'s all okay, because it feels real. People are jerks, friends fight, people grow up and apart and they continue to struggle onward. I really am at a complete loss as to why I didn\\'t read these books earlier. They are one of my all-time favorite series\\' even though this book\\'s ending just broke my heart.  realize that most amazing books all have a big sacrifice aka some major IMPORTANT character who has a piece of my heart just goes and DIES  but that doesn\\'t mean I have to like it. More to come after I read the final book - I\\'m immensely sad just think about how it\\'s the LAST book :( So, I wrote a review for this when I read it but accidentally deleted a whole bunch of reviews when I was reorganizing my shelves... So I guess I just have to read them all again so I can give accurate reviews :D From my re-read of this series, I have determined that this is my least favorite Harry Potter book. We\\'ll have to see if that still stands once I\\'ve read Deathly Hallows again, as its been so long I don\\'t remember much from it. Unfortunately, I can\\'t really figure out why I didn\\'t like this one as much. I think maybe because it has less humor, and less exciting little side stories? I\\'m really not sure. It just doesn\\'t have quite the same spark as the previous novels. In this book we learn about Horcruxes through Harry\\'s lessons with Dumbledore. Harry is made captain of the Quidditch team, and the teen romances play a much larger role. Draco is up to something; Harry thinks he is a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione don\\'t believe him. The Half-Blood Prince and Harry\\'s potions book obviously play a large role, and his identity is finally revealed at the end. We learn the backstory for Voldemort as well. This is I think the darkest HP book, although the last book in the series comes a close second. I have not read this series in ages and therefore I think forgot a lot of the major plot points that are necessary for the final book in the series. The main characters are again Harry, Ron and Hermione and this is the first book in which they are seriously thinking about having a relationship. There is some serious tension between Ron and Hermione as they both clearly have feelings for each other but are reluctant to say anything to the other. The other main thing affecting the story is Voldemort\\'s rise and Dumbledore\\'s plan for Harry which drives the whole book. The secondary characters include the other Hogwarts teachers and pupils and the Order. Ginny comes into her own in this book and is a fantastic character. And for the first time Draco Malfoy seems to be a real threat. The storyline is excellent and the pacing is great, full of tension all the way through leading to an almost shock ending (if I hadn\\'t read the book before). I am already reading the last book in the series but still appreciate all the little bits about this book. 4.5 stars In no way do I diss Harry Potter, but I must say that I was really disappointed by the length of this book. Read oon the blog! Okay before you guys say anything let me make one thing clear. I know that the whole world has read this book and nobody would even want a review for something this awesome but you see, I have to do it. I love this series and it\\'s not going away from me without at least a review. So I started reading this series three months ago (yeah yeah I am stupid whatever). I was never actually interested in reading the books. I had seen all first five movies and half of the sixth one when I realised that I had to read the books to really grasp it all. And so it began. The end of my normal life but the beginning of one so much more cooler. As I read on I realised how stupid I had been for not even thinking of reading it when the HP books were all around me because my whole class had read it and Beez was annoyed with me reading it now! when everything was over, the books, the movies, everything but I still read on and now I am obsessed. This book is great. Everything from character building to the plot is perfect! I wish J.K.Rowling would come to me personally and smack my face for not having read this earlier. If someone out there has still not read it, then read it, from the first book to the last and trust me you will never ever regret having read it. It\\'s a fantasy that is out of any of our imagination! I love how finally we find out Voldemort\\'s weaknesses and the ending is just fabulous, I was sobbing for half an hour after the book was over and also laughing hysterically when I remembered all the punch lines that were in the book. I rate it a 5 on 5. The best thing that has ever happened to me. I am officially a potterhead! Lots of love and pasta, Raven ** spoiler alert ** Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is by far my favorite book outside in and outside of the Harry Potter series. The writing is simply superb and offers devoted readers into the depths of Voldemort\\'s past, while offering us some budding romance amongst characters. I was constantly reading, and could not imagine putting the book down once I was at a good part. I thought that Harry\\'s teenagerish attitude was toned down in a pleasant way due to the fact that he was becoming so insightful into the mind of his greatest enemy and realizes that he must be the one to kill Voldemort. Harry POtter has always been an emotional read for me, but the waterworks were multiplied this time as I cried at Harry\\'s trimuphs and tribulations. But, by far the saddest moment of my life so far has been Dumbledore\\'s death and funeral. I cried myself to sleep, resulting in squinty eyes and a palid complexion the next morning, but I could have cared less, because one of my favorite fictional friends has just died. Needless to say, I have never gotten over the shock and horror of it. can\\'t see my screen through the tears this re-read has been MOST painful and utterly worth it This book is very much more about the origins of Voldemort than the others were. So far, my least favourite of the series (next to the Goblet of Fire). Harry is in top form here, though- not the whiny, angry brat of the previous book, and he gets quite a bit snarkier, which is nice. However, I don\\'t think I could really get into it because the first three quarters is rather boring- mostly it\\'s just teenage wizard drama, which is only slightly more interesting to me than normal teenage drama (that is to say, not very). The story really seems to lose its way here. The ending, though, was action-packed and lovely, which I hope is a sign of things to come for Deathly Hallows, and not just the beginning of a painful decline. Initial thoughts: My anger at what happened towards the end of this book is overshadowing how I feel about it as a whole. Review to come when the rage dies down. Review: Actual rating: 4 Never-Have-I-Ever-Felt-So-Much-Rage stars. No spoilers. I\\'m not even going to attempt to write a full review for this book. Why? There\\'s a bazillion other detailed reviews out there. Instead, I will share with those of you that are reading this my feelings on this book. I reached a poignant section towards the end, and found myself yelling at the book. I was on the other side of the country at the time I read this. I\\'d just gone to Harry Potter World at Universal Studios Orlando with my fellow book nerd friend Annette and our husbands. So I got the itch to read this one. I borrowed her hardback copy of it. If it hadn\\'t been for that, I would\\'ve taken my rage out on the book. I sent some very hateful and rage-filled messages to my friend Annette. Not directed at her, of course. I needed to vent. I hated Rowling for what she did. I said I wasn\\'t even going to finish this book after that part. I walked away from it. I wouldn\\'t have finished it or even completed the series if Annette hadn\\'t twisted my arm and convinced me to. I calmed down. I finished the book. I finished the series. And I haven\\'t written Rowling off my list of authors I will read. However, I don\\'t agree with what she did. Annette tells me it\\'s necessary for the story. But that doesn\\'t mean I have to like it. The rest of the book was sooooo good, I can\\'t avoid giving it less than 4 stars. My rage almost put this on the DNF shelf with 1 star though... Always wish we could see more of Harry and Ginny\\'s cuteness You know what is wholly amazing about rereading these books? You pick up on teeny tiny little things, that BRING elements of the whole story together. \"The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog\\'s Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was. Mundungus! THIS SCENE IS MUNDUGUS SELLING SIRIUS\\' MIRROR TO ABERFORTH HELLO CAN WE APPRECIATE HOW THIS IS TRULY WONDERFUL. Sorry this is a waste of a review, it was too long to post as a general update, and I felt like I had to say it. It keeps getting better. After Goblet of Fire, I was blown out of my comfort zone and started down a dark path. Order of the Phoenix added to it, by showing just how far the enemy infiltrated the world. Now, in the Half-Blood Prince, we finally can see the light at the end of the tunnel, the darkest days with a small glimmer of light, hope. This emotional roller coaster of a novel is the best thus far. Deserves a full 5 out of 5 stars and just screams, ready part 7 immediately after. To Ms. J.K. Rowling, Biggest plot twist ever and this book actually surprised me for Miss J.K. Rowling\\'s attempts to romance! I loved it to bits! 2nd read before movie #8 A good number six on a long series. I liked getting to see different sides of well known characters. How Draco fears for his and his families life but doens\\'t really want to hurt anyone. Harry and Ginny finally get together, we finally get to know more about Snapes history and start the real work finding horcruxes. I wasn\\'t fond of the scene with Dumbledoor and harry in the cave. It was meant to be scary, but I found it ludicrous. I did like the scene where Snape saves Draco\\'s ass and kills Dumbledoor. Snape is my favourite antihero ever! I am listening to this book for about the 6th time. I need a story which will carry me along without much effort and yet capture my interest and challenge me to see more than I saw the last time. There are confusing times in my life when this comfort read is exactly what I need and Rowling and Jim Dale, the narrator, always deliver. In this book, Harry finds a potions book from a former student and when he follows the instruction, he produces extraordinary results. Hermione is deeply troubled by the book and insists that he turn it in. Who is the Half-Blood Prince? It is hard to review this book without giving the plot away, so I will stick to the generalities. We learn a lot more about Tom Riddle and how he came to be Lord Voldemort. The reader begins to have a little sympathy for him...until he reveals his cold bloodedness at such a young age. It goes way beyond the mind of a schoolboy. We get to see a lot more of the pensive and it begins to reveal the prequel to the stage that is set for Harry when he comes to Hogwarts. I think the pensive is an absolutely brilliant device. I would love to have one myself! Suddenly, Harry is there, seeing the people in the past as they were without being interpreted by flawed memories. I think the memories also reveal the depth of Rowling\\'s talent. She has constructed these books as if she knew from the very beginning just where she was going every step of the way. Tiny bits of information in book 1, come back in book 6 and their importance is revealed. In fact, I think that is why I keep coming back to these books. I make connections that completely eluded me up to that point. I am in awe of the depth of her organization for what is ostensibly juvenile fiction. jeez, i forgot how long some of these books are. Dumbledore dies. There. I ruined it for you! muahahahahaha! Time for a re-read! Best of the series. Getting towards the end of my audiobook reread! I think I might have only read Books 6 & 7 once when they originally came out (as opposed to the multiple reads the others got before each release) so it\\'s been great revisiting them. Jim Dale is fantastic as always. Faster, richer, and more productive than the previous installments. Now finally we\\'re getting somewhere. This one didn\\'t drone on and on about teenager problems as much as the past two books. While yes, there are some dating troubles that come out of nowhere, usually it\\'s quite funny and temporary, instead of dramatic -- I can mock the characters more easily for their halfwitted fumblings, and move on quickly to the real plot. There are also many things recalled up from the past: places, names, and past events are actually acknowledged and used in the plot. Finally Rowling isn\\'t expanding her wizarding world as much as she is focused on using it to develop characters. But Ron is still annoying as ever in this one. Some things never change. But at least something bad happens to him, that I could laugh at. Malfoy and Snape are left in the background for most of the book, and you don\\'t know what\\'s going on for months at a time. It\\'s simply tiresome that their mysterious situations are continuously brought up in Harry\\'s questioning mind, with no resolution until the end. Although I suppose you have to put the climax somewhere. And a lot of the dialogue toward the end felt very contrived -- as if Rowling suddenly had to get out a lot of information and just stuck it in anyone\\'s mouth. ut at least Dumbledore\\'s death made up for it!  large amount of annoyance can be made up for by the tragic and meaningful death of a main character. o good book is complete without killing off at least one person who is important. But I liked this one the best so far -- now Voldemort actually becomes a realistic villain, with a past and a motive. He gets his own plot, so to speak, no longer just a scary mysterious force in the shadowy background. Finally Dumbledore actually talks to Harry about specifically what is going on with Voldemort. Finally some questions are answered. I just had to get through six books to reach it. But Harry is still as obnoxious as ever in this one. Having hindsight about what\\'s really going on with Snape and Dumbledore shows to me just how much of a dunce he is. And even Dumbledore seems foolish and ignorant -- both he and Harry should have trusted and communicated with each other much more throughout all these years. Just ask each other! Tell each other what\\'s happening! You could save a lot of tears, time, and effort. Also, now that I think about it, the whole situation with Ginny really bothers me. She\\'s not developed at all in any books leading up to this. In this book she\\'s forgotten again, until one day Harry realizes he likes her. Are you really that lazy, Rowling? Come on. Your main character sucks so much that you have to make his romantic interest sit stale and useless in the background, until your protagonist finally notices her for a bit, before dumping her again? I\\'m not even going to set this off as a spoiler, because it\\'s such a minor part of a much deeper story, and so insignificant for Harry and Ginny as characters. She sits there and takes Harry\\'s \"I\\'m so brave by myself\" moment, because it\\'s some subtextual, poignant relationship stuff? But there\\'s no foundation. Ginny is just another person Harry rejects as he goes off to try by himself, until he will ultimately screw up again and have to be bailed out. What a lame excuse for a romance. Why couldn\\'t it be deep and meaningful and have a foundation that\\'s actually been set up in the books before this? Or even in the beginning of this book! Alright, on to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows! Oh man. This one is much much better than I realised the first time I read it. Killer. Great Story. Can\\'t wait to read the next one. We learn a lot more about Lord Voldmort\\'s background. The overall storyline moves forward pretty well in regard to Harry, Dumbledore, Draco Malfoy and Snape. Another fabulous addition to the Harry Potter world. This book, like the rest, delves into the life of Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived. The characters in this series are so well developed that you will fall in love with many of them. The world building is very dynamic and many people that read the books are waiting for their letter inviting them to Hogwarts (even those of us over the age requirement of 11.) I reread this series every 2-3 years. I assume that at some point they will grow old but it has been 15 years and I still love them with a fiery passion. This book finally usurped PRISONER OF AZKABAN as my favorite. Intense with fantastic character and relationship development, great background on Voldemort, and powerful ideas about love and family. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. Holy crap. If I thought Order of the Phoenix had the most heartbreaking ending, well, this one just left me lying still and unable to speak for hours. I\\'m absolutely devastated and frightened of what\\'s going to happen next now that the person we all look up to is dead. The thing about Dumbledore is that he seem to hold everything in place. As though everything is right in the world when he\\'s around. And seeing him vulnerable and weak was just painful and distressing. I really enjoyed reading this one, it showed more of where Voldemort came from and it just has that evil vibe in it, making readers curl up in their seats like they belong to the wizarding world. What I noticed in this story is that it grows as Harry grows older. I love it. I really wish I hadn\\'t seen the movies before reading these :( But the experience is so much different and I still recommend reading them even if you\\'ve seen the movies a thousand times! Definitely one my favourites, if not my favourite, in the series. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince......... OMG HERE WE GO! ... What do I say? As always, it\\'s a knock out of the park. This whole series is just a masterpiece. Somehow, even into the sixth book, I don\\'t feel bored with the story yet. I\\'d think that by now, I\\'d be bored with it. They follow the same pattern. Harry at home, eager for an adventure, gets the call to adventure, train ride to Hogwarts, first few classes, typically a new DADA teacher, in this one a new potions teacher, problems with Draco, Quidditch stuff, Christmas break, Harry gets more suspicious and tries to figure out what\\'s going on, big plot twist as the bad guy isn\\'t who you expected, school year finished, head home. Somehow, though, the books are all enjoyable. I\\'ll add on top of that that I\\'ve seen the movies, and still pretty vividly remembered Half-Blood Prince and all the events that transpire. Sadly, this means of course that I knew the plot twists and turns. It was still enjoyable, though. For some reason, maybe because I\\'ve been reading the books consecutively since December/January, I\\'m not chomping at the bit to read Deathly Hallows. Maybe it\\'s also the dread of being the last (main) Harry Potter novel. I\\'m still really curious to see exactly how Snape is presented in the final book - I know most of the plot twists, but I still need to see how it\\'s explained in the books. For instance, I think the movie doesn\\'t explain at all the origin of the name Half-Blood Prince. So I\\'m hoping the book explains some of the lingering questions I have about Snape. I\\'m also very curious to see how the final book is presented compared to the movie. Since they had to make two movies out of one book, I\\'m curious if they moved scenes around to sort of give each movie a beginning, middle and an end. So! No question about this one. Five stars. I\\'m also beginning to regret my having given Chamber of Secrets the lone four star rating in the series (I think). Looking back at it now, although Chamber of Secrets seemed to be kind of ho-hum, it really does add many important things to the series. Ginny\\'s interest in Harry, more about the Ministry of Magic, hinting to Horcruxes, Tom Riddle\\'s diary, the name Tom Riddle, more about Harry speaking in the language of snakes, and so on. I don\\'t know, but that book just appeared to not really live up to its predecessor. But a LOT happens in a short amount of time. But anyway, Half-Blood Prince. Five stars of course. The whole series is truly a masterpiece, and deserves every bit of acclaim it\\'s been given. I really hate the age we live in, it\\'s so full of stupid and evil people, and we have so few great leaders nowadays. No Martin Luther King\\'s, no Thomas Jefferson\\'s, no George Washington\\'s. A lot of our literature I think is over-rated, authors appealing to teenage girls who go crazy for fads. But despite it all, I do feel a measure of pride to know I live in the same time as J.K. Rowling. To think if in times gone by, you lived in the days of Austen or Dickens or Twain or Poe. But I can say I lived in the days of Rowling. That makes me feel a bit better about life. At least there is one great person in the world who I know walked the earth the same time as me. At least there was one significant addition to literature that happened in my lifetime. Sadly, it took me a couple decades before I caught onto it, but at least I finally got around to giving the series a genuine chance, and I\\'m real glad I did. If somehow you haven\\'t read the Harry Potter books yet, whatever your reason, quit being an idiot. You are really missing out on a masterpiece. You\\'re walking right by the freaking Mona Lisa and aren\\'t even stopping to give it a glance. Argh! I cried all over again. #1 favorite of the series. Something I hadn\\'t noticed before: Rowling\\'s fondness for the phrase \"at once.\" I was very bored at first, but ended up really enjoying this book. This book is the definition of sexual tension. It was killing me! I was very frustrated with the characters for reasons that I can\\'t say and the ending completely shattered me. I was crying and I was in school so you can imagine the looks I got. I would have enjoyed this much more if I hadn\\'t known who would die and who the Half-Blood Prince was. I was spoiled majorly and that really hindered my entire enjoyment of it. But it was still a fabulous installment in this series and I am looking forward to reading the final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Plot- 9/10 Characters- 9.5/10 Writing- 9/10 World Building- 9.5/10 Total- 9.2/10 Quickie Review- Another fantastic book in the Harry Potter series. The whining of Harry and his friends were not as frequent, and while you could tell they were still teenagers, it wasn\\'t irritating. More complex relationships formed, and the plot took a darker turn. The addition of the horcruxed made the plot interesting, what with the exclusion of quidditch and the Triwizarding Tournament. The climax was beautifully done, and while it was chaotic, it was controlled and well-executed, so I knew what was going on. This was also a turning point for Draco and his role in this series. He really took a strong position as an antagonist. As well, the twist with Snape at the end was unexpected and awesome. It set the stage for the last book. ** spoiler alert ** So you would think after all of these emotions and comments and everythings about being engaged my fiance and I would be glued together at the lips because we are obviously very much more in love than the rest of the people in the world who are simply dating. Or maybe it was because of these overwhelming emotions that caused him to simply say, \"Want to just read together for a while? I know you\\'ve been wanting to finish the sixth for a while now.\" And that is yet another reason that caused me to realize, yes, I do not need to have minor panic attacks over whether or not this man is right for me because he accepts the fact that I am twenty-one years old and still reading Harry Potter. I remember the exact place I was sitting when I read Dumbledore\\'s death scene for the first time, and now I remember the second. The first time I was sitting on the edge of my bed, broke down in tears (partially because it was late into the night, and partially, of course, because Dumbledore just freaking died). The second time I was sitting in bed, next to you. You were reading that novel about the monks and the kidnapping, and I was reading about Malfoy having internal conflicts about good versus evil. The first time I read Dumbledore\\'s death scene, I was so overwhelmed that I skimmed the rest of the novel, because, quite frankly, it is just too much to go on. The second time I read Dumbledore\\'s death scene, I was so overwhelmed that I skimmed the rest of the novel, because, quite frankly, it was still just too much to go on. I put my head on his shoulder and sighed. He looked down at me. \"Dumbledore...he.... \" I whined. He smiled. \"Oh...\" he said, in that falsely sympathetic tone. Not growing up with the series, he will never fully understand, but I appreciate the fact that he tries. MAAAAAAAAAAAKE OUTS. I know a lot of awesome stuff happened in this book, but really, I can\\'t get past Harry\\'s snark and the fact that everyone is constantly trying to make out with each other in this book. God, I love J. K. Rowling. She\\'s hilarious. I thought this book was as hard to put down as the previous book in the series. I\\'m glad I was able to start it on a Friday night so that I could spend lots of time reading it over the weekend. This next week is probably going to be frustrating, though. I\\'ll be anxious to read the last book but I won\\'t have nearly as much reading time as I would like during the work week. I\\'m giving this book 5 stars for the same reason I gave the previous book 5 stars - because of how much it gripped me and took over my life, causing me to spend every spare moment possible reading it. But that doesn\\'t mean I like everything that happened in the book. I really can\\'t write anything else that wouldn\\'t risk spoiling the fun (and in some cases torture) for anybody who still hasn\\'t read this series, so the rest is in spoiler tags. k, I know I said in my last review that I wanted to see more of Dumbledore, and I was really happy that this book had so much of him in it. here were some really great moments between him and Harry. ut I hated that he died! f all of the characters Rowling could have killed off, he was the one that I least wanted to see die. t might be odd, but his death had more emotional impact on me than I think either Ron\\'s or Hermione\\'s would have if one of them got killed. n the other hand, Dumbledore\\'s death didn\\'t take me completely by surprise. \\'ve had this niggling worry since the very early books that he was doomed to die by the end.  can\\'t even really explain why. aybe it\\'s just that the character type - kindly, wise, elderly mentors - don\\'t often seem to fare very well in fictional stories.  just kept hoping that I was wrong.  had thought it would happen in the last book if it happened at all, though.  can kind of see the point of doing it in this book, for the sake of Harry\\'s character growth since he is the main character after all. his forces him to be the one making the big decisions now. arry won\\'t have Dumbledore\\'s wisdom to fall back on (even if he did ignore it way too often) or the safety and rescues he often provided. here were some things that didn\\'t add up, though.  was always waffling about where Snape\\'s loyalties were. t\\'s hard to consider somebody to be one of the \"good guys\" when he holds onto his anger so steadfastly and when he treats people with such prejudice. laming Harry for his father\\'s behavior was unfair and irrational and, if he was really working against Voldemort, it seemed like he often put his own petty interests ahead of the good of the cause. o I was never 100% sure - was he as evil as he acted? r was he a misguided and hateful person who was still genuinely working against Voldemort? r was most of his behavior a big act to make certain Voldemort would believe he was still working for him even when he wasn\\'t?  usually swung toward one of the last two explanations because Dumbledore trusted him and I couldn\\'t imagine Dumbledore being wrong.  know he wasn\\'t infallible, but I figured he had a really, really good reason for trusting Snape. arry believed that Dumbledore was bamboozled by Snape\\'s apparent regret about leading to the death of Harry\\'s parents when Snape hated them to begin with. hat doesn\\'t make sense to me because Dumbledore was definitely not a fool. e was wise enough to be cautious about Tom Riddle, so why would he be any less cautious with Snape who had undeniably been serving Voldemort? t just seems like there had to be more to Dumbledore\\'s belief that Snape could be trusted.  also thought it was weird that Dumbledore said \"Please\" to Snape right at the end, as if he was asking him not to kill him. hat\\'s how Harry interpreted it, anyway. f Dumbledore really had realized at that point that Snape wasn\\'t really on his side, I still don\\'t think he would have done anything remotely like beg for his life. t seemed wrong and completely out of character. o I can\\'t help but hope there\\'s some sort of trick going on - that this was some sort of an elaborate ruse and things aren\\'t really as they appear.  know that\\'s really unlikely, though. e know that Harry apparently became unfrozen from his paralysis the moment Dumbledore died, and his phoenix Fawkes began mourning shortly after his death also. he characters all saw his dead body. nd we saw Snape agree to the unbreakable promise that he would help Malfoy accomplish his objective which Malfoy made pretty clear was to kill Dumbledore. n the other hand, if Snape wasn\\'t really on Voldemort\\'s side, then he surely would have told Dumbledore about the plot and they would have had time to come up with something... but I\\'m probably overthinking it just because I didn\\'t want Dumbledore to die. k, moving on! here was quite a bit of teenage romance angst in this book. ore than I wanted, although at least the Harry/Cho thing seems to be well over with.  didn\\'t like Cho at all. inny is at least likeable. he Hermione/Ron thing got a little annoying, though.  don\\'t mind a relationship developing between the two of them, and it\\'s been obvious that was coming from early on, but the immature way they handled it got tiresome.  know, they\\'re teenagers and their behavior wasn\\'t abnormal, but I still didn\\'t really want to read about it. nd I wanted to throw my Kindle across the room every time I read \"Won-Won\". ech. n response to my review of book 3 on BookLikes, there was a bit of discussion about the Time-Turners. o I thought it was worth pointing out that they were referred to again in this book. arry, Ron, and Hermione are talking to Hagrid about why they didn\\'t sign up for his course this year and Hagrid suggests they could have \"applied for Time-Turners\" and Hermione tells Hagrid that they \"smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners\" when they were there. his seems to imply that there\\'s an application process by which people can request to use Time-Turners and that there are several of them. n book 3, it had seemed to me like Hermione was given a bizarrely unique experience by being allowed to use one, but this seems to indicate that it wasn\\'t unprecedented. here was also the tiniest hint of them in the previous book, but it wasn\\'t clear if Time-Turners were actually being referred to so I didn\\'t mention it in my last review.  loved the first chapter in this book where we get to see the muggle Prime Minister learn about magic and interact with the \"other minister\". hat was a very funny chapter and I enjoyed it even though I was anxious to get back to the main characters. umbledore\\'s interactions with Harry\\'s family a couple chapters later were hilarious too. One more book to go! I love this book. There\\'s not much else to say other than I love it and I really don\\'t want the series to end. 5/5 stars. At a loss for words, but, fortunately, I don\\'t need to even say anything. Everyone knows this is wonderful. On rereading, I think this is my favorite of the series. Hogwarts as Hogwarts, older kids=more interesting, less of Harry charging around angry, plus OMG ROMANCE. Not to mention that it\\'s really suspenseful and well-constructed. My only problem is the ridiculous Spider-Man style \"We cannot be together because it is too dangerous for you!\" bullshit. I don\\'t believe it for a second. OMG OMG OMG THE ENDING!! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT... Haha! Just kidding. While this book has been on the shelves for around 11 1/2 years (releases in July of 05), I know new kids are coming up and reading them. Adults that didn\\'t when they were younger are reading them so I couldn\\'t put a spoiler right at the beginning but like my other Harry reviews spoilers may pop up so I wouldn\\'t continue to read if I were you. Anyway...and yes this is more summery than review. Curse me. I just finished and I need to TYPE. The penultimate chapter of the Harry Potter saga, the Half Blood Prince seeings Harry even more upset than he was at the start of Order of the Phoenix, having lost his godfather at the end of that adventure. He is depressed, sad, and missing Sirius desperately. He also feels completely out of touch as to what is going on as no one is saying anything for fear of it getting caught in the wrong hands. Understandably. You really do not know who is on what side, not really, even if you think you know do you really? Luckily Harry is soon sent to the Burrow after helping convince Horace Slughorn to join the staff of Hogwarts. Harry thinks he is going to be their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher since that position has a new face every year. At the Burrow he learns that Bill and Fleur (from Goblet of Fire) are engage and to be wed the following year. Such happy news in otherwise dark times. Harry suspects Malfoy is up to no good because, well, he is Malfoy. The young wizard runs off to Knockturn Alley and into the dark magic shop Harry had found himself in back in year two. Malfoy as usual is acting suspicious, setting off half of Harry\\'s motivations for much of the book. At school, they learn Slughorn is now the potions teacher and Snape has finally earned the role he so desperately wanted, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. This is all much to our heroic trios dismay. Whatever Dumbledore and the other members of the Order may feel, they don\\'t trust him, Harry least of all. Since Slughorn is now potions master, Harry and Ron are able to join his NEWT class, having earn the proper grade. Which begs the question...if a student failed most of their OWLs...what do they do when they go back to hogwarts? Just go to the 1 or 2 they passed? Repeat? Maybe they just don\\'t come back? Then again Crabbe and Goyle are back so I guess they do just repeat. Anyway, in the NEWT level potions class, Harry manages to get his hands on a copy of the text that was owned by someone called \"The Half Blood Prince\" (ROLL CREDITS!). Having learned nothing from his previous adventures, Harry keeps the book and uses it to his advantage, gaining high praise and favor from Slughorn. Oh and earning himself a vial of liquid luck (to touch on the movie for a minute, the liquid luck scene is easily one of my favorites in the series). Harry also has secret, private lessons with Dumbledore. Knowing he will tell anyway, Dumbledore says Harry is free to say what happens in their meetings to Ron and Hermione (Dumbledore ain\\'t dumb). Through the pensieve (AKA memory pool of silver goo), Harry is taken through key points in Voldemort\\'s life, seeing his parents, his life at the orphanage, his time at school, and after he left Hogwarts. Each memory provides more and more insight into the Dark Wizard Harry feels he has to fight because of the prophecy. Even after Dumbledore explains the prophecy is irrelevant. Voldemort made it come true and that even if Harry hadn\\'t heard what it was about, he still would\\'ve wanted to end Voldemort\\'s life due to all the pain he has caused young Harry. Again, Dumbledore ain\\'t dumb. In one of the memories, we learn about Horcruxes. Well we almost do. The memory was tampered with and Dumbledore puts it on Harry to get the real memory from Slughorn, the reluctant witness. Harry is otherwise distracted by not just school and Quidditch but by following Malfoy. Katie Bell (a teammate of his) and Ron are both cursed by dark magic. While both survive, Harry is sure Malfoy is behind it and that his intent was to kill. Since Slughorn won\\'t provide the memory willingly, Harry focuses his attention on Malfoy, sure he is using the room of requirement to do whatever is he is doing. Pressured heavily by Dumbledore, Harry finally does manage to get the memory from Slughorn by using the vial of \\'liquid luck\\'. (AGAIN, love this scene in the movie) Essentially, he got Slughorn drunk at Aragog\\'s (the big spider from Chamber of Secrets) funeral and convinced him that he needed to give up the memory. The memory does provide a bit more insight into horcruxes. You kill someone and put a bit of your soul into an object or thing. Say...a diary or your father\\'s ring. What this means is, you can\\'t be completely killed, not while part of your soul is trapped in an object. Voldemort wanted to live forever and he found a way. An evil and dark way. Also kind of sad. Imagine having part of your soul trapped in a spoon for all eternity. These lessons also show Harry why the DADA\\'s position is cursed. Voldemort wanted it. Dumbledore, not be dumb, said no. Could you imagine Voldemort teaching? He would have a ready made army of hundreds all too soon. Since saying no, Dumbledore had been unable to find anyone to hold the position for more than year. This almost brought out a bit of a continuity error from book one as the way Hagrid introduces Quirrell, it seems as though he has held that role for a while but while Quirrell had been at the school for a few years, Harry\\'s first year at Hogwarts was his first year teaching DADA (it isn\\'t directly said in the books but was later cleared up by Rowling and as she is the Goddess of all things Harry Potter, her word is gold). Dumbledore finds the location of one of the horcruxes and he takes Harry on a journey to get it. It one of the more difficult parts of the book (at least for me), Harry forces a potion down Dumbledore\\'s throat at his request in order for them to claim the horcrux. They nearly get killed by some zombie like creatures but manage to escape back to the village just outside the school where they see a dark mark in the sky so they fly back to the school. And here the shit hits the fan. Draco, under orders of Voldemort, is supposed to kill Dumbledore but he can\\'t (Harry even ends up feeling bad for him after this if that says anything) so what happens? Snape does it. Snape. Kills. Dumbledore. The world shattered when they read that, when word got out to those who hadn\\'t finished the book yet. I still remember it clearly. Everyone was cursing Snape\\'s name (and the name of the guy who drove by people in line just after midnight and shouted \"SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE\" out his car window). At least a first. A few theories cropped up later about what side Snape was actually one, leading to some to not quite want to see Harry kill him in the next book (except that guy in the car. Fuck that guy. Harry can kill him.) But that first night and day, everyone hated Snape just like Harry did. He wasn\\'t on the good side after all. He was always on the side of Voldemort. Other things that happened: Tonks wants to be with Lupin (he eventually gives in), Ron made out with Lavender Brown to piss off Hermione. Hermione pretended to like some guy who\\'s name i can\\'t be bothered to look up right now. And oh...Harry kissed Ginny. Right in the common room. After Gryffindor had won the Quidditch cup again. In front of Ron. Harry isn\\'t going back to Hogwarts. He wants to find the last 4 horcruxes to defeat Voldemort. He wants to kill Snape too for obvious reasons. Overall, a great read. So much happens that needed to happen to bring us to the final showdown in the next book (which I\\'m sad to say I only read once. I know I\\'m horrible). Harry learns a lot more about Voldemort. Probably more than he wanted to know but what he needed to know. Sometimes knowing the motivations behind someone\\'s behavior is helpful in knowing how to defeat him. Voldemort wanted to be the most powerful, he wanted to hurt people from a young age. Of course he would hide his soul into objects that did not belong to him. Of course he would be arrogant enough to believe that putting his soul into 6 other places would give him power beyond measure. But he is still human..sort of. Well he was at some point. Now he\\'s a giant dickhead with a lot of power like our president. But he can be defeated. Harry knows how. He just has to learn to trust in his friends and in himself. This is my favorite book in the Harry Potter franchise. New mysteries were added, the suspense really kicked up a notch, and we saw new insights into familiar characters. The writing flowed smoothly, and the story progressed at a very reasonable pace. Harry Potter and the Dumbledore is Never Straightforward About Anything, Ever. Also Harry Potter and the It\\'s Not Who You Think It Is, Harry, Part 2. My least favorite so far but still great. In the end accounting, I think this is my favorite of the books. Less whiny than the book before, and tighter. But long enough for details that I savored. I actually like this more than the fifth now. Ooof. Heavy end. Good set-up for the end, though. I\\'m just a lot not okay... This book was fantastic. A lot of relational developments and naturally development to the over arching plot. This book was so fast paced and so eventful I can\\'t really believe I\\'m done with it already. It doesn\\'t quite compare to The Order of the Phoenix but it tops all the others before it. I can\\'t believe I\\'ve come this far in the series and how emotionally involved I am in these books. The ending left the most bitter taste in my mouth for I too felt betrayed and horrified by the events that occurred. Ugh I am too emotionally damaged and drained to say anymore. THIS BOOK. THE FEELS. THESE TEARS. MY HEART. The plot turned even more intriguing. In this book, Hogwarts is not as safe as it used to be. The deeply-felt emotions of the characters propel action. Harry couldn\\'t help but notice that some of them are mysteriously up to something. Dumbledore, and Malfoy especially. I LOVED READING EVERY BIT OF THIS BOOK!!! The twists and turns of the plot, no matter how heart-wrenching a lot of them have been, gets me every time. The part in the beginning where Arthur and Molly Weasley exchanged questions as a precaution to make sure they were not Death Eaters was beyond adorable. This is also the book where I realized that Draco Malfoy is not a boy who made bad choices -- He just never had a choice. Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. WHOOP THERE IT IS. DRARRY is real. Even after their Sectumsempra encounter, I still ship Draco and Harry. The tension between them is palpable. \"It\\'s okay, we can fix it,\" said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand. \"I love you, Hermione,\" said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily. Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, \"Don\\'t let Lavender hear you saying that.\" WAAAAAAAHHH FANGIRL MOMENT. This is the first time Ron finally said \"I love you.\" to Hermione. I ship them so hard. ROMIONE. Half-Blood Prince = Severus Snape Professor Snape finally got to teach Defense Against the Darks Arts in this book. He is absolutely one of my favorite characters. Like Draco Malfoy, he\\'s also in a fix. He didn\\'t have a choice but to follow what Narcissa Malfoy and Professor Dumbledore asked of him. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. -- Albus Dumbledore Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is a character revered by a great number of people. He is certainly one of my personal favorites. I was so heartbroken when I first watched how he died in the movie. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I still couldn\\'t help but be sad all over again after reading it. Reading this book made me feel all kinds of feels. Both the book and the movie has a dreary vibe (in terms of color, background, and atmosphere.) Another excellent read. My heart, my feelings... excellent because we finally get a good look into voldemort\\'s backstory here. although rowling starts to introduce so many new ideas and elements, it\\'s pretty mind-boggling to think that she has to wrap all this up in book 7. i may have been the only person in the world who was not THAT upset by the death at the end. i was more affected (oh let\\'s face it, i still am!) by the death in book 5. Rereading HP books at the age of 22. Still equally awesome. OH MY I have 19 day to finish the Harry Potter series CHALLENGE ACCPETED This one keeps you wondering about who is the half blood prince. I cried and cried at the end of this one even though I knew the ending was inevitable. By the end of the book, it seems like it should\\'ve been joined with the next one. It\\'s probably the most depressing end of any of the books in the series. I\\'ve got tears in my ears from reading the end of this while lying on my back in bed. This one moved soooo much faster than 5. Loved it. Most recent re-read in November 2015. I love this book so much and all of the horrible feels it gives me. This book is amazing. Absolutely brilliant. The plot is so intricate and thought out to perfection, every little detail worked out. The ending is so sad, and full of darkness and death ahead, but lit with rays of hope. I love this book, I love the whole series. Competely amazing. There was no waking from this nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors had died, and he was more alone than he had ever been. No one warned me this series would break my heart over and over again. DRAMATIC END ! The story continues of course. There were some great moments in this one ! Ron and Hermione getting together ! Harry And Ginny ! That escalated way too fast ! Strange to say but the Romance part of the book was only the entertaining part for me ! Until the end drama of course. The entire time the story was so dull. Stuck only to \" What\\'s MALFOY DOING ? It missed that \\'adventure\\' part of fantasy world. There were hardly any new characters or new places. So yeah. I had to push myself through 75% of the book. The ending was good! That saved the book ! SPOILER Woah! Snape killing dumbledore ! Couldn\\'t have thought abt it ! That was certainly unexpected. Why did Dumbledore trust Snape so much? I hope they answer that in the next book. The last book I think will be the best one ! Also I still don\\'t approve of Fleur and Bill\\'s Wedding :p ** spoiler alert ** Brilliant story. Knowing what I know now, having read the series all the way through a few times, this reread provided much more depth. For example, I had never caught the fact that Voldemort truly did curse the Defense Against the Dark Arts position (pg. I mean, I had assumed, but I had never truly known.  understood Snape\\'s actions this time through as well and it made the book all the more interesting as I tried to work everything out. \\'ve also decided that Hagrid acts as a bridge between the understood and the feared; he is a friend to all creatures, deadly or not, and it is he who carries Dumbledore to his tomb and he also carries Harry back to the castle when Voldemort believes him to be dead .  loved watching the friendship between Ron and Hermione blossom into a romance, not to mention the relationship between Harry and Ginny which doesn\\'t really get anywhere until the end of the book. All in all, this is a very good book and it is a part of a brilliant series I believe I will enjoy in every stage of my life. Update: 8 times I\\'ve read this book. I enjoyed it far better in this reading because I didn\\'t let myself spend the book furious at Dumbledore. I\\'ve done that in the past and all it did was make the book a chore to get through. I\\'m still bugged at Dumbledore and his secrets, and bothered that no one ever listens to Harry despite the fact that her guesses proved to be right nearly every time throughout the series, but in a far more reserved corner of my mind. Severus Snape\\'s betrayal was more fun to read with this attitude as well. Who cares if everyone\\'s wrong about him? For the sake of this book, he\\'s a traitor, and after all the abuse he has thrown at the students throughout the rest of the series, I\\'m quite content to send him some hate in return. (Yes I know he\\'s fictional, but why on earth should that mean that my feelings about him and the impact the books have had on me aren\\'t entirely real?) I grew up reading HP and I have always loved it, every bit of it! Half-blood prince for me was the best novel. I really think it showed a bigger part of the pre-story we never knew before. Also it showed what made Snape exactly the way he was. I\\'m not going to spoil it for anyone who ( has lived under under a rock and) haven\\'t read it,but I strongly reccomend it. This is my favorite book in the entire series. Harry, Ron and Hermione are no longer little kids but they are still at Hogwarts. I love that they are finally moving into having relationships and falling in love (which is usually my favorite part of books). In this book Dumbledore is finally has a big role and appears several times to help Harry better understand Voldemort and the task at hand. Finally, in this book it is spelled plain out that Hermione and Ron have a thing for each other, this was my favorite part when I first read this book. I remember when I first read the part with Ron taking the love potion and I didn\\'t realize what was happening only that he was telling Harry he was in love with someone I was absolutely ecstatic in thinking he meant Hermione. I was wrong of course but I still love that chapter. Then on top of Ron and Hermione we get a love interest for Harry too. I However didn\\'t like this relationship as much but eh it\\'s slightly better than Cho and Harry. Now that I am re-reading the series I have found that I just don\\'t feel any chemistry between Harry and his love interest. I think that is why I just don\\'t feel as interested or invested in his love interest. First he likes Cho but up until the moment that he states how pretty she is while playing quidditch against her she isn\\'t even mentioned, then every time after that when they encounter each other Harry\\'s thoughts tells us how much he likes her and this is fine and dandy but I just don\\'t feel a connection with his fancying her. Pretty much he just decides oh I like Cho because she is pretty and I don\\'t really know her but I\\'m going to pine over her for the next year or so until I actually go on one date with her and realize she\\'s a complete pain and at that point I will pretty much just forget about her all together. For me it just doesn\\'t work I need interaction and little hints of chemistry. Now as I am reading this book I again feel a lack of a back relationship between Ginny and Harry before he is over his head in love with her. Sure in book 2 we are introduced fully to Ginny Weasley\\'s character, outside the little platform introduction that I don\\'t count from book 1, she is Ron\\'s little sister that has a sort of celebrity crush on Harry. Harry saves her life and all that good stuff but they are like twelve so it\\'s not some epic romance in development just Harry living up to the Hero role. After that Ginny pops in and out of the books casually always seen pretty much for being Ron\\'s little sister and we don\\'t really get to see her development into her teen years the way we do with Harry. For me until the fifth book (and even for a good part of the fifth book) in my mind she is still that little eleven year old trapped in the chamber of secrets. The fifth book Ginny is a more frequent character starting in the beginning chapters and until the big battle at the ministry but still I don\\'t feel any kind of inkling that either Harry or her like each other, she has a few boyfriends in this year and I guess that is a hint that she isn\\'t the little girl anymore but really Harry doesn\\'t notice or have any pang of jealousy. (Still talking book 5) Yes, I know this is because he is in la-la I love Cho forever imaginary land but still I want a little development and chemistry; let\\'s face it Ron is jumping down Hermione\\'s throat every time he mention\\'s Krum why can\\'t Harry show some of these emotions. Even after Harry has completely wrote off Cho and we move into the sixth book where he is going to get with Ginny there\\'s not really any hints until almost halfway through the book. I feel like it would have felt more satisfying for me if there had been bigger hints towards this relationship before it just was happening, then I could have been at least cheering for Harry and Ginny. When I read this book the first time I was right there with cheering Harry on to be against Snape and Draco, this time I just see how foolish Harry acts becoming so obsessed with them. He is repeatedly told by everyone to just let it go and in the end being himself he doesn\\'t listen. I think his hate for these characters is always causes Harry to have twice as many obstacle\\'s then he would have. As I read this time I paid close attention to Snape and how everything between him and Dumbledore could have two meanings. If Harry would have just trust Dumbledore instead of insisting he could make mistakes he would have save himself a ton of time and energy. Ever since I finished the entire series years ago Snape has been one of my Favorite Characters. I seriously cry every single time I read or watch Snape\\'s last memories. This time as I re-read this book I kind of thought of something I never put too much thought into before and that was that everyone saying if Dumbledore had so much trust in Snape why didn\\'t he give him the DADA job. Now I guess it\\'s pretty clear to me that Dumbledore knew that the position was cursed and didn\\'t give him the job because he need him to stick around, but then gives it to him in the sixth year because he knows that it is time for Snape to leave and join Voldemort. In a way I guess that when Snape was given the job at the beginning of the book it should have been obvious that Snape would be leaving Hogwarts by the end of the book and not returning as the Dark Arts teacher. This book gets me ever time also, late last night while I finished off that last few chapters of this book I was crying like a baby the whole time. When a book can make me feel that much, that is what makes it a favorite book for me. I enjoy books that make me cry. One last thing I want to mention before a top five list is the artwork in these books. When I started re-reading the series the pictures were kind of silly looking if I am being honest. But around book 4 the art gets so much better and this books art is probably my favorite so far. I thought the change and development of the art through the books was very interesting. Top 5 Favorite Parts Harry and Ginny kiss Arogog\\'s Funeral Tonk\\'s and Remus The entire last three chapters Ron taking the love potion I cried so very much with his book... I think in this book you can start forseeing the end of the saga, but not that much that make it predictible. I like what J.K. Rowling did with this book and with the whole saga i will never get over the ending of this book and i will cry, as i just did, every time i think of this book. no words can describe this book or how i feel about it. oh my god. Ugh the feels. I was hit with them all over again. I am probably going to fly through the seventh next...so much for re-reading them slowly. ** spoiler alert ** Ok so I am so behind like the whole world right now. And now I can imagine the shock that everybody received years ago. I am going to hide my review because of spoilers. But here is what I think.... I love Snape. I love his character, he is so misunderstood and I just could not get through this series without him. I don\\'t care if I end up being dead wrong, but it was all planned. Dumbledore asked Snape to kill him. I JUST KNOW IT... And Snape is not a traitor he can\\'t be. Dumbledore was no idiot. He trusted Snape. I don\\'t know why Dumbledore thought this was how it had to be. And there is a small part of me that thinks Dumbledore might just rise from the dead. I still can\\'t believe it. Dumbledore is the greatest character. I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do if Dumbledore really is dead. Ginny as Harry\\'s girl. First of the all the movie really played this up but I just don\\'t get this relationship. They hardly ever spend any time together and now all of sudden Harry is into her. I mean I never shipped Hermione and Harry, no way. But Ginny really??? Can\\'t we do better than her... Plus don\\'t you think it is really creepy that she looks just like his mom... I mean just like her. Anyways, I\\'m freaking out right now because my best friend who got me into this crazy series in the first place is not answering her phone... and I need to talk about all my feels in regards to this book....... My head is spinning right now. I have to get my hands on the next book. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince by J.K. Rowling is the 6th in the series. Harry Potter continues to enthrall. The books, although for all ages, are getting darker. We have lost Cedric. We have lost Sirius. Now we lose another. It starts with visits...the Ministry of Magic visiting the Prime Minister in the Muggle World.....Narcissa Malfoy visiting Severus Snape....and Dumbledore visting Harry at the Dursleys. A new Potions teacher, Horace Slughorn will join the school, and Snape will be teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts (much to Harry\\'s disappointment). Slughorn has a secret that Dumbledore desperately needs, and he instructs Harry to discover it. Dumbledore and Harry will work closely together to try and put an end to Voldemort. Harry discovers he is excellent at Potions, as long as he uses the instructions in the book he found by someone called the Half-Blood Prince. This book may not be a good idea. Harry is suspicious when he saw Malfoy in a store called Borgin & Berkes. He thinks Malfoy is a death eater, like his father. When strange things happen at school, they seem to confirm his suspicions. On a lighter note, sort of, romance is in the air, and it is putting a strain on the relationship between Harry, Ron and Hermione. When Ron discovers Hermione kissed Viktor Krum, he is not impressed. Suddenly he is dating Lavender Brown. Now Hermione is not impressed. Harry is finding himself very interested in Ginny, but doesn\\'t know how to tell Ron. The ending is not happy. We lose someone else. Someone we have loved since Book 1. We know there is a reason for everything, but it is so hard. Deep breath. Okay, Rowling did another superb job of leading us from one dark event to the next, with so much suspense thrown in and an ending that takes us by surprise. How could you not want to continue? This is the first of the books that I bought on the release date- lets just say I came a little late to the party. However I am ashamed to say that it took me almost a full year after the release date to get around to reading it. At the time of the release I was working for a book store and after the thousands of calls I made to let our customers know that their copy would be available, all the events that were planned for the day, and the weekend itself I was a little Harry Pottered out for awhile. When I did finally get around to reading it I was pleasantly surprised to find a much more likable, less whiny Harry. My favorite Harry Potter book! This one is absolutely amazing, and is an all-time favorite of mine. This book has it all. I\\'ve read it three times, most recently because of the premiere of the movie. Read in 2007 Getting close to the end of the series and i\\'m excited and at the same time a little bit sad. I can\\'t think of the Harry Potter\\'s books as different part, to me they feel like the same huge book and everytime i read a new chapter. i really liked how i watched all the characters grow up and face uncountable dangers, all of this created a sort of bond. With every new part i feel like meeting old friends. This part was a little bit different, more interesting and touching. I liked it how the life of Lord Voldermort was retraced, he was no longuer just a shadow. i greatly enjoyed this book and i can\\'t wait to read the next and last one. Definitely the best Potter book I have read in my binge catch-up on one of the biggest cultural phenomena of the last decade or so. I did skim read some of the earlier books when they branched off into all the coming-of-age teenage stuff, which don\\'t really appeal to a man in his forties. This one I didn\\'t skim at all, as it stuck largely to moving the story on and setting up the conclusion. I liked all of the previous books a little better than this one. In this the story dragged on a little and I just wanted to get to the end. First Read - release night Second and third - ? Fourth - 2013 The Ones that Love Us, Never Really Leave Us Dumbledore, you will be missed <3 This was a re-read for me. Things I liked/noticed about this particular installment: + I really like Professor Slughorn. He\\'s just so good-natured in this one, and I love how he throws all these parties and everything. It\\'s oddly hilarious to me. + LUNA. Luna Lovegood is my favorite character. She\\'s actually probably in my Top 3 favorite characters of all time. I know that if I went to Hogwarts we would get along so well. + The disappearing cabinet with Malfoy doesn\\'t play as big of a part as it does in the movie? Which is a weird thing to say, since Harry is obsessing over Malfoy the whole book, but we don\\'t really  know  he\\'s up to something until the very end. + Quidditch. I love it in this one. How Ron proves himself to be a good Keeper without any help, when he thinks he took the lucky potion. + It\\'s always killed me a bit inside that the diadem was RIGHT. THERE. This has always been one of my favorite installments in the Harry Potter series. It doesn\\'t have very many boring parts in it. I will probably re-read this again in the future as well. This has got to be one of the best books in the series! It amazes me how J.K. Rowling manages to always come up with new plots and new twists when it comes to the story of Harry Potter. It never gets boring or cyclical. You can always expect one surprise after the next. In HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOODED PRINCE, Rowling breaks down a lot of background information for the books before. She takes us into the past and delves into the history and lives of many characters. We begin to realize that things are not always as they seem. There is not much to say in this review, without giving away too much of the book, but I will say that it is the most emotional of all six installments. You definitely get a sense that finality is not far away. There is of course death in the final chapter ... which is extremely tough to accept once you find out who, but what is harder to believe is the way it went down. This occurrence also will have HP fans wondering how in the world will Rowling continue the next phase of the Harry Potter series... ** spoiler alert ** First thing that came in my mind... \"bakit? bakit? si Dumbledore pa?!\" (Why? Why? Does it have to be Dumbledore?). But then I guess as the book and Harry\\'s story continues, life is not always rosy and good. Yet again, this is a very great book, as much anticipation had been build up for the last series. What did I do to deserve this. I\\'m blinded by my tears now so no review When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love. Here J.K. Rowling was getting me used to longer books, but for this one she trimmed off a few hundred pages. Honestly the story didn\\'t contain as much in some ways as the previous two that were longer, so the page length fit it. It\\'s that semi-awkward stage book where it\\'s going to lead to the last big-bang fight and wrap-up, has to introduce new stuff for the story but play on the old without wrapping that up just yet. Harry has lost his mope from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, feeling accepted again amongst his peers and not left out in the dark any longer, but he retains the natural anger and fear that he should have in his circumstance. There\\'s some mini developments between him and a female character romantically wise, which to me fits the series well. Hermione and Ron also are leaning toward each other more, even if they haven\\'t made it officially official just yet. If you\\'re a fan of Dumbledore, this book will both please and infuriate you. He\\'s in more scenes than ever while he gives Harry private lessons, showing both his and other people\\'s memories, all leading to a fascinating backstory focusing on Voldemort. You don\\'t actually get to see the monstrous villain in this book - you only hear about him, which is typical of the earlier installments. There\\'s a few death eaters popping up though, including Fenrir, a new big-bad I hadn\\'t noticed before, a demented werewolf of all things. Can I just say this guy is actually creepy? Especially his focus on hurting and turning children. As always these books are impossible to put down, since Rowling\\'s writing technique not only rocks, but she gives us unique characters who are individuals standing out from each other while working toward standing together unified. Rowling always introduces a new stand-out character in books; here it\\'s a new potions master who enjoys fame and getting to know students who he has determined are \\'going places.\\' Dumbledore has something else up his sleeve about this teacher, too... Pacing wise it\\'s okay, as this book is more of a filler than anything, but it does give us one big revelation concerning Voldemort. All the other books pointed toward this, but it\\'s now more obvious coming together when Harry sees the larger picture. While a stepping stone to the next book, \\'The Half-Blood Prince\\' is in no way boring. You get to see Harry with his friends and relationships, a little in the classes and especially wondering who on earth the Half-Blood prince is. That mystery intrigued me since I couldn\\'t figure it out for awhile, and I\\'d forgotten since watching the movie years back. While the new potions teacher is introduced, Snape finally gets his turn at \\'Defense against the Dark Arts.\\' I was slightly bummed we didn\\'t get to see more time spent in his class, however. I\\'ve always enjoyed the classroom teaching and experiences in the other books, and here was a chance to see freaking SNAPE of all people talking about the dark arts! Unfortunately there\\'s just the one classroom moment. Although we don\\'t see too much on the teaching side, Snape is still brilliantly constructed and a page-stealer when he comes on scene. As with the previous book, there\\'s a heartbreaking ending to this one, so have the tissues handy. I\\'ll keep them handy when I go on to the next and last book, where I know more depressing stuff will happen. And of course I\\'ll need tissues just knowing it\\'s the last book and that it\\'s time to get off this ride. These books keep getting better as they go. Great twists and turns, and a very fun story. IGGPPC March 2015 I\\'ve got the feels!!!! This book had me in tears! It had such a sad ending. This has to be my favorite Harry Potter book so far. I loved all of the flashbacks in the pensive. It gave more insight about Tom Riddle and his evilness. I\\'m so happy that Harry and Ginny got together. I\\'ve heard most people say Harry and Hermione should have ended up together, but I disagree. I think Ron and Hermione are perfect for each other. She keeps him in check. Drake Malfoy has gotten more evil and become a death eater, but that didn\\'t surprise me. I love Rowlings way of writing. She is extremely creative. oh gosh, I need the Deathly Hallows NOW This is where I pretend the next book doesn\\'t happen so I can continue feeling vindicated in my dislike of Snape. This book also makes me happy because Dumbledore gives Harry much more information and better prepares him for what lies ahead instead of being quite so cryptic. I also like Slughorn and he makes me feel a bit better about Pottermore sorting me incorrectly into Slytherin. There is a practicality about him that I like - when he gathers venom from Aragog, for example. This isn\\'t one of my favorites to reread but I do enjoy remembering how shocked I was by many things in this, such as the introduction to he Horcruxes and being obsessed with trying to figure out who RAB was. Reread 2016 Tears. Lots and lots of tears. This book was actually kind of terrifying! And what a finish... Made me laugh, made me cry... maybe my favorite in the Harry Potter series. I would give this book 6 stars if I could. This is still my favorite HP book and Ginny is still my favorite character. 11/1/10 - Starting up the series for, what, the eleventh time? Part of my personal HP challenge in which I must read books 1 - 6 before the release of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1\" on November 19th. Started #1 on 11/1/10, finished on 11/4/10. Started #2 on 11/4/10, finished on 11/6/10. Started #3 on 11/6/10, finished on 11/8/10. Started #4 on 11/8/10, finished on 11/14/10. Started #5 on 11/14/10, finished on 11/17/10. Started #6 on 11/17/10, finished on 11/19/10. I just barely scrapped by! I finished the sixth book on my lunch break on the 19th. It was touch and go for a while (I struggled with finding enough time to get through the fourth book), but I got it done in the end. ;D Now that I\\'ve seen the movie in theaters (twice! ), I\\'m planning on taking a leisurely stroll through the seventh book. This series will forever be the nearest and dearest to my heart. Loved it! Dumbledore takes Harry under his wing and shares with him glimpses of Lord Voldemort\\'s past. Harry learns what he needs to do before this last show down with Lord Voldemort arrives. First read: 2006? Second read: May 2012 Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect I cannot review HP but this I can do. Image in big size. Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect READING THIS BOOK WAS LIKE THROWING A THOUSAND NEEDLES TO MY HEART I wish I was writing this review before having already read book number 7. Just to be able to remember the feelings the book made me have for Snape, but I\\'m not saying anything more just in case you\\'re among the few lucky that still have a Harry Potter left to read for the first time. However, my general mood about this book has not changed through the years... I feel book number 6 is a very long introduction to the epilogue of the saga in book number 7. It doesn\\'t have the tension of neither book 5, 7 or 4. The best parts are the beginning and the end, i.e. the parts that don\\'t take place at Hogwarts, or that are not related to school in the more general sense of the term. That being said, this is still a Harry Potter, and even if it is not one of my favorites, it\\'s still a world class book. Glad you won\\'t experience the pang of disappointment at the end of it because you feel you needed more, as, lucky you, book 7 is already out there and you\\'ll not have to wait a whole year or two as I had to back then. I\\'m so glad to be reading these books finally. But I\\'m terrified of ending the series though. Then it\\'ll really be over for me. It\\'s been over for everyone else for so long. But I feel like it\\'s only just started for me, and I haven\\'t had enough time to savor the story. I don\\'t reread things as much now as I used to. But I\\'m loving this series now that everything is happening. Really, I\\'m just so glad there\\'s kissing now. Why did it take so long for there to be kissing? Okay, because they were babies. That\\'s a good reason. But geez, I like a little romance with my almost dying all the time. Anyway, I\\'m in love. I\\'ve been heartbroken. I know certain things are going to happen because I watched th movies one time years ago. But I never remember when they happen or how. So I\\'m been constantly surprised and gutted by the big reveals and betrayals and whatnot. It\\'s been a great rollercoaster. I\\'m already starting HP7, so I don\\'t really have time to give this more of a review. I\\'ve got to get listening. I knew what was going to happen i still cried i just dont understand why anyone has to die So Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is my least favorite HP movie, so I was pleasantly surprised that the book is a lot better. Even though, I kinda missed the whole deatheaters scene at the Burrow during Christmas, it was still way better. I throughly enjoyed this! Obviously a re-read, this time in english. Looooooooved it even more, if that is possible. Goodness gracious. JK Rowling, what are you trying to do to us? I don\\'t want to write a long review or spoil anything, but it was a good book. Dumbledore and Harry got closer, and Dumbledore became another father figure of Harry\\'s. hy do all the father figures die?! \\'m going to miss Dumbledore so much, he was one of my favorite characters. JK Rowling added more romance than there were in the previous novels. All the ships start to come up and I love all of them. Unlike other books, where romance and action are basically the plot, the romance was prominent and noticeable without drawing away from the action. It was really good and I liked it. Can\\'t wait to finish the series! So far, #3 and #6 are my favorites of the series. I\\'m glad that Harry got a little less whiny in this one than he was in #5. Another solid Potter novel. The Tom Riddle material is dark and excellent, though I wish there had been even more of it. I almost gave this book four stars again, but I can\\'t quite bring myself to do it. This is my least favorite book of series, but it still gripped me cover to cover. The main reason for my relative dislike is that not much happens in the book until the last third/half, though the ending is incredible. I do not like Ginny in the movies: she comes off as flat and uninteresting. In the books (especially this one), however, she is witty and works well with Harry. She is just as much a prankster as Fred and George, and though their reputation overshadows her, she is confident in who she is and just does whatever she wants. In the movies, Slughorn is perfectly depicted. Narcissa Malfoy should have been more ruthless. I wish Voldemort\\'s eyes had been red. Previous rating:  in late 2009/early 2010 My least favorite book in the series. Although Rowling\\'s writing and the wizarding world is as enjoyable as always, HBP is over-long and with not much plot; it\\'s basically a place-holder in the series. Forced to finally admit that Voldemort is back and again on the rise to power, the Ministry of Magic and the magical world are in an uproar. The magical community is finally starting to side with Harry and Dumbledore, at last believing that things are in disarray, and acting accordingly. But school must go on for Harry and Co., and while there are no O.W.L.s looming, classes are still as demanding as ever. Add to that Harry\\'s private lessons with Dumbledore, where he learns as much as he possibly can about his arch-nemesis in preparation for their epic prophesied showdown, and an altogether new Potions situation, and it\\'s all the Chosen One can do to keep it together, never realizing what dreadful and horrific events await at the end of the year. Seven years since the last book came out, I decided it was finally time for my 6th (I though it was 7th, alas) read-through, and my first time all the way through from start to finish. I think with these I\\'ll start by writing what I can remember about my initial thoughts and then review them properly. 9 YEARS AGO: Again, this book\\'s release was a most exciting and eagerly-anticipated event for me and my sister, and the bookstore midnight party (at which my artwork was featured) only increased our excitement. At the time this book affected me even more than OotP did, just with what happened, and how it happened. I loved how the kids were growing up, it was hard to find fault with the story, and at a certain point I felt I had to put the book physically down and take a moment to process what in the wizarding world had just happened. THIS YEAR: After all these years I can look at this book objectively and say that it\\'s not among my favorites. It has a LOT of great things going for it, and it has plenty of drama and thrills and humor, but there\\'s something about it that feels kind of like an in-between story, like it\\'s just marking time and dropping information before the final chapter (which I guess it is, though I don\\'t think it HAS to feel that way). As usual, the storytelling is compelling and there\\'s some vivid descriptions of new characters and settings, and the characters are in top form, though evolving as people do when they stop being children and start growing toward adulthood. This is by far the steamiest book in the series, with much more emphasis on romance (read: hormones) and dating than ever before, which is natural, and which doesn\\'t really seem to distract from the overall plot, in fact it rather enhances it. Sure, some of the kids break character now and then, but I think that happens in real life when young people start to notice and attract/be attracted to those of the opposite sex. One of the great things about this book is that Ginny finally starts to come into her own. She started to show some spirit in the fifth book, but this is when she really emerges as a force to be reckoned with. I feel like the tent-pole scenes with Harry and Dumbledore in the Pensieve are placed just right and given just the right amount of attention, revealing plenty of intriguing clues and information about Voldemort\\'s past without dragging on. I really like how much it starts to tie in so many things from previous books, especially CoS, and adds a lot of little touches that make the whole thing seem really cohesive (whether those touches were planned during the writing of the earlier books or not). It starts to give the series a real feeling of cohesion with bookend elements. There are a few well-placed twists (new DADA teacher?? ), and though the mystery itself isn\\'t as engaging as some in previous books (eurgh, too much Snape), but it keeps the story moving along and adds some nice drama. Some parts drive me a little crazy (like the continued complete ineptitude of the Ministry and how the lead-up to the finale basically ends up meaning nothing, and also of course how Dumbledore is incredibly presumptuous and still unnecessarily secretive, and of course Snape), but it continues the mood established in the fifth book and builds up nicely to what we could only have guessed would be the most glorious and satisfying finale in all history of literature. (Was it?... Stay tuned to find out.) In the end, this book is a lot about Snape, and I really don\\'t like Snape. It\\'s also a lot about Voldemort, who I also don\\'t love, but I guess it\\'s pretty important to find out stuff about him. This one feels sort of like a rest stop in the series, but it does a good job of bridging the fifth book and the finale, while our favorite magical now-definitely-teenagers continue to weave their way through the winding walkways of life and learning and (oh yes) love. march 2014: just reread. one of the best things about book 6 is that harry is not the annoying, moody boy of book 5. i also like that we learn a lot more about a lot of characters outside of the main trio. urprises:  this book reminded me that ginny is much more awesome in the books than in the movies. ut i\\'m not sure that i understand what a bat-bogey hex is... to boogers with bat wings fly at you?  the possibility that voldemort actually cursed the defense against the dark arts position when he was denied it.  i love that arthur weasley\\'s dearest ambition is to figure out how airplanes stay up. This was the first book I ever read twice. I had to read it again right before I got the last book. Relative to Books 3, 4, and 5, Book 6 doesn\\'t contain a lot of action. Rather, there is a wealth of conversation, of human connection (and disconnection), of uncertainty and, most importantly, revelation. I certainly don\\'t mean any of this in a negative way - I was halfway through the book before I knew it, gobbling up the exquisite plotting and story. So many layers of subterfuge and distrust and confusion were sown throughout, many coming to a head, others only beginning to see the light of day, saving themselves for that final chapter in the series. Harry and the reader together learn many fascinating and mysterious things over the course of the book, and the dearth of action does not seem so great a burden, lulled as we are into the realm of discovery and understanding, before everything ultimately implodes in more than one gripping, astonishing, unbelievable burst at the end. I wrote in my review of Book 5 that Harry finally experienced consequences for his actions. In this entry, he progresses even further down the path to adulthood by learning that there is always something below the surface, that he is not protected, that he can be at once right and terribly wrong. (However, he still hasn\\'t learned to give more credence to Hermione\\'s theories, which would\\'ve saved him some trouble.) He also discovers, somewhat to his surprise, that despite all he has lost, he still has his friends. His childhood now decisively over, Harry faces his uncertain future with the boldness and bravery of Gryffindor - and with both love and hate in his heart. I usually take a little break between each Harry Potter book, to contemplate things for a bit. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be able to with this one. Goodness, I feel for those who had to wait a whole year after this ending... Overall, I liked this a lot more than the previous installment. I enjoyed the mostly slower pace, and seeing more interaction with Dumbledore. I did think that the title (and reveal of the Prince\\'s identity) was ultimately a bit anti-climactic. I\\'m not sure if it was supposed to be a red herring and I was supposed to think it was someone else or what. Oh well. I don\\'t know, after book 4 it just seemed to me that J.K. Rowling didn\\'t enjoy writing any more. The plot feels forced and heavy. Also, why did Harry\\'s dad had to be such a bully? That he wasn\\'t perfect, sure, but as he is discribed here you just can\\'t like him anymore. Oh my goodness. I definitely never read this one on my first read when these books were all released. If I did, I 100% do not remember anything that happened in this book. I feel that this was the most intense one of the series so far. Can\\'t wait to read the last one! I feel like this is a Harry Potter book that I know least well. I\\'m sure I\\'ve read it is many times so we read the others but I just feel like I don\\'t know the story of the characters involved in the same way as I do with the other books. Maybe that\\'s because I haven\\'t seen the film many times, in fact I think I\\'ve only seen it twice, or maybe it\\'s that this book just feel very different. For me this book is like an onion, and as much as it hurts me to quote Shrek, it has many layers to peel back and to investigate. I like the in-depth analysis into what makes Voldemort tick. I like finding more about his past and how this is shaped the very situation that are well known characters find themselves in. Most of all, I like changing pace and feel. The characters really feel like they\\'re coming of age, like they\\'re old enough to understand what\\'s going on I might actually now have the tools and the life experience to battle everything they\\'re going to face. And thus begins the most disheartening \"beginning of the end.\" I hate to admit that I never read this book when the series was released; this was my loss because this book is outstanding. The intricacy of the plot is admirable in and of itself, but this book also sets the seventh book up perfectly, all while continuing critical character and story development. There was so much backstory I missed with the sixth movie, so I was so glad to get it in the book -- particularly Voldemort\\'s history. And speaking of, this book certainly keeps in line with the pattern of the series becoming progressively darker; in the Half-Blood Prince readers are thrust into increasingly dismal and tragic territory. I was crying by the end of it. I think this book may be competing for a top slot in my rankings... P.S. I fully recognize that at this point that virtually everyone has read this series and has their own opinions. My reviews on these books aren\\'t intended to add anything new to the discussion; they\\'re largely for my own reference, so I can remember which aspects of which books I enjoyed :) Reread Dec 31st, 2016 - bumped up to 5 stars because Harry Potter The last Harry Potter book I read was The Half-Blood Prince. I\\'d already seen the movie, so I skipped this one and tried reading Deathly Hallows. I couldn\\'t remember a whole lot of the movie aside from the final few scenes. Re-reading it was an interesting experience but I can see why it wasn\\'t really that interesting. After reading Order of the Phoenix, I noticed how long the books dragged on. The plot has a lot of filler and often dodges the main storyline or tends to dedicate entire chapters to seemingly minor details down to Harry\\'s new annoying house elf, an examination at the new minister of muggles, Ginny\\'s new love interest and the Half-Blood Prince himself, who has a seemingly minor role in this book. Even though the book is named after him, it didn\\'t seem to be the main focus at all here. The story focuses on a few main things: Professor Slughorn\\'s long-forgotten memory of Voldemort, Malfoy\\'s secretive shenanigans and the identity of the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. Like I said, the Half-Blood Prince himself feels rather unimportant, in particular to the other two dilemmas. The first one, Professor Slughorn\\'s memory, involves Harry making several feeble attempts to appeal to him. The latter dilemma doesn\\'t seem very out of the ordinary. Throughout the entire series, Malfoy has always been a rather suspicious character and casting him for a villain was bound to happen sooner or later. However, seeing Malfoy as an actual villain makes me uncomfortable, especially in comparison to Voldemort. Malfoy comes across as the obnoxious school bully - who\\'s had minimal character development past six books - rather than the big bad evil being to be feared. At most, he\\'s just an annoying sidekick who should get kicked around. I suppose that overall, these main questions were my main gripe with the book. It seemed that the entire book was built up for the twist ending and that there were only two important points in the book: Voldemort\\'s secret and the dramatic ending. While building up to it is inevitable, it seems that over 600 pages worth of build-up is largely uneeded. On a side note, Snape\\'s character was one of the more interesting endeavors of the book. We tend to get vague clues as to whether or not he is good or evil. This book explores that idea a lot more, though it tends to gravitate towards evil much more. Of course, this has already been going on through the last couple books anyways, so there\\'s nothing terribly new. Though many will disagree with me, Harry comes off as a Mary Sue, or in this case, a Gary Stu. He inherits all of Sirius\\' old possessions (and gracefully doesn\\'t want one of the buildings he\\'d owned), is credited for saving half of Ron\\'s family and gets attention from plenty of girls trying to get into the Slug Club. He also happens to be Dumbledore\\'s favorite student and the most adept person in his Potions class. On a side note, somebody did reveal how the naming of the characters in the first book seemed to come off as a cheap trick. For example, Malfoy\\'s mom is named Narcissa, which sounds a lot like Narcissus. Fenrir Greyback is a werewolf, and his name is an allusion to a wolf god in Norse mythology. Another wolf, Lupin, has his name sound strikingly similar to Lupus, one of the scientific names for dogs. To me, it does seem a bit cheap. I mean, it\\'s cool to allude to mythology, but in real terms, how many Fenrirs were destined to grow up to be werewolves? To put it in better terms, it reminds me of Cruella DeVille from 101 Dalmatians, whose name is clearly meant to resemble cruel devil on account of how evil she is. Anyways, much like Order of the Phoenix, this book tends to drag on a bit more than it really should, but the last few ending chapters are rewarding and help set the dramatic stage for the final book, Deathly Hallows. It gives some interesting insight into Voldemort\\'s history and features one of the most dramatic moments in all of Harry Potter history. In spite of everythingb, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a yr=ear or ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with ron and hermione. The end was so sad:c One of the great books in a great series - funny, filled with adventure, with a shocking ending. Escapist literature doesn\\'t get better than this. Omg I could not put this down! FREAKING SNAPE OMG AND DUMBLEDORE AND THE FEELS AND UGHHH Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermoine are the real ships to sail that\\'s all I\\'m saying Harry still annoyed the hell out of me though. I loved it and I want the next one immediately but I\\'m prepared for tears. Sorry if this review is a mess. My heart is dead forever The entire wizarding world knows of Voldemort\\'s return. As Harry Potter returns for his sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he knows that things will be different this year. Dumbledore has special plans that require Harry\\'s secrecy as together they plumb the depths of Voldemort\\'s past in the hopes of finding a way to defeat him. This book has less angsting than the previous book did. It is easy to get drawn into the tale of Voldemort\\'s past and aside from Harry stalking Draco for half the book, this was pretty enjoyable. I haven\\'t read this for a while now and all I really remember of the movie is that they took out a lot of what made this book interesting. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would and even knowing the ending I still had a blast rereading it. The penultimate book of a well-crafted series. ***Reading Challenge 2016: A book with a first name in the title*** First, imagine someone driving a dull, rusted dagger through your chest. Your skin is all torn up, possibly irreparably damaged and deformed, and the pain is unlike anything you\\'ve ever felt before. Now imagine someone whom you love dearly taking that dagger and twisting it slowly and then ripping it out of your chest before doing the same with your heart. Imagine them crushing it before your very eyes. Imagine the hurt, the betrayal and the heartache you\\'d feel. That\\'s how I feel right now. I\\'m completely torn apart and heartbroken. Who knew a book could affect my emotions so drastically. (Well, I did, but that\\'s besides the point.) umbledore\\'s death , though I\\'d expected it because of spoilers I stumbled across online, still came as a shock to me. arry has witnessed so much loss and grief, firsthand... And to think Snape  was the one who did it! After all those semi-spoilers I saw of him turning out to be a hero or whatever, learning that he had done it was crippling. I suspect I\\'ll only feel more heartache as I continue with Deathly Hallows. I\\'m ready for the pain:)))) And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure. **Spoilers Alert . This is the only Harry Potter Book that I didn\\'t review yet, the sole reason is that the end was marvelous, amazing , that I just didn\\'t wait to write the review and started the deathly hallows instantly . however I loved The Deathly Hallows and didn\\'t wait to write this book\\'s review to express my whole ocean of feelings about it . So, somehow the review was never written , but no damage done because one of the Harry Potter perks is that not even a tiny detail is ever Forgettable . The story starts as always with the Dursleys . this time Dumbledore has a trip for Harry before he settles in the burrow and then back to Hogwarts . as the events progresses Harry is lent a potions book by Professor Slughorn, an old friend of Dumbledore\\'s who they convince to step by their side and eventually teach potions in Hogwarts . in the book Harry finds a number of notes from it\\'s previous owner, which allows Harry to excel in a subject he has never been more than average at. The book is marked \"Property of the Half-Blood Prince\". Who\\'s this half blood prince , the potions brilliant ? Hermione is slightly suspicious but they have too many other things in mind to bother much about it . Harry is a little affronted by Dumbledore\\'s disinterest in his doubts and fears . anyways soon we\\'d be introduced to what\\'s called Horcruxes  and dive in their mysteries . I love this book , its fast paced , nothing seems safe anymore , everything is at risk even Hogwarts that has always been the safe haven . its quite dark at places . the flashbacks that tell us about Voldemort\\'s / Tom Riddle\\'s past is so absorbing . I always like to read the stories of the villains , I like to know what led them to be whatever they are . Also in this book we can notice that Rowling seems to be trying for more complicated prose and more sophisticated storytelling than each of her previous books . There are plenty of questions left unanswered by the end and We also learn a lot more about the characters, We even see whole other sides of them , maybe change our model thinking about them . Draco Malfoy is one of these . The final plot twist , which is Dumbledore\\'s killer identity is absolutely unforeseen even shocking {if it\\'s not spoiled for you , off course } and Dumbledore\\'s death overall is devastating , the one who was always been there to solve problems , the background Hero , their savior , the strongest wizards in the world\\'s Death puts everything at stake . His death is one of the most emotional . The only two deaths that made me cry were Dumbledore\\'s and Dobby\\'s . Though I have to admit that if I had the choice to bring one character to life that most definitely would be Fred , but when I say emotional I mean that we had time to cry , to mourn our loss . Fred \\'s , Sirius\\'s , Lupin\\'s , Tonks\\'s . All these deaths happened in the middle of a battle , in the middle of a sentence we had no time to feel them fully at the time .But Later they\\'d hurt when Re-reading the books or when thinking about the whole image but while reading You\\'d feel Dumbledore\\'s and Dobby\\'s the most . At least that\\'s what happened with me . Yes ! off course Dobby is still alive here , also all the other characters above but I am generally speaking . All in all , its a Harry Potter Book , That\\'s an enough compliment , I loved it as much as I loved all the other books maybe slightly more than few others . *Peace upon your hearts You who are going to read the deathly Hallows . Get yourselves ready , you\\'d need self control and tissues , Yes paper tissues you\\'d need that * READ IT HERE Recensione su: http://wp.me/p3X6aw-4x Review on: http://wp.me/p3X6aw-4x To my mind, this episode in the HP saga shows Harry at his most complex. The romance with Ginny that everyone hoped was coming finally gets a kick in the pants, he is given a new leadership role (Quidditch captain) while also engaging in dubious behavior. He experiences moments of empathy toward Voldemort and Draco Malfoy while clinging tightly to his distaste for Severus Snape. And in the final pages he is launched on his final quest to take place in the seventh book. Best bits (back to Dumbledore): \"Ah... how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute.\" (Dumbledore, 359) \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\" (Dumbledore, 510) It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. (Dumbledore, 566) Wow, it\\'s been a while since I read this the first time. We learn so much more about Voldemort. I am still clinging tenaciously to my trust of Snape, though it is difficult. I am hoping that Dumbledore was right. Anyway, this is probably my 2nd favorite of the series so far. This story follows Harry\\'s exploits as he spirals closer and closer to what seems to be a murky and dark future. The writing is, as ever, superb and witty as you\\'re drawn into the darkness and depth of Harry\\'s world. Angrier and moodier, Harry\\'s suspicions grow ever wilder as he tries to piece together the actions and behaviors of his school \\'enemies\\' and the frustration that comes with not being listened to or taken seriously. This book really brings to light Harry\\'s compassion and lets us see how he realizes that all is not always what it seems. Brillant plotting, fun and scary all at once. J K Rowling is a genius. Read Jan 2010 - Feb 2010 Read Jan 2011 - Feb 4/11 Read Jan 2012 - Feb 4/12 Read Jan 11/13 - Jan 29/13 Read Feb 28/14 Read Jan 4/16 - Jan 25/16 I\\'d say smthg but I don\\'t want to spoil it for shqiponja I need a moment... Maybe a day, but knowing me I won\\'t give myself any and I\\'ll start reading the deathly Hallows any minute now The story plot was very interesting. I actually really liked it. I stopped reading though, because the book was making me frustrated and annoyed. Harry and his friend\\'s attitudes about the things they went through and the inconclusive resolve of the issues they faced just grated on me. I\\'m generally affected by the feelings of others and even the feelings of fictional characters. I wanted to finish the series, but when it was making me so frustrated and upset, it didn\\'t seem wise to continue. Having finished most of the books, I will say that the things I most disliked about the book were the \"promotion\" of disobedience. Harry really didn\\'t get punished...almost ever, for doing almost every single thing that should have gotten him expelled from the school. Well, I guess he did get detention, but the book always seemed to portray such occurrences as unwarranted and unfair. I understand that Harry might have seen it that way, but that doesn\\'t mean that the whole attitude of the book should reflect Harry\\'s immature focus. The other things I didn\\'t like were the absence of Ginny and the wallowing in depressing feelings. The first I disliked because, well, who doesn\\'t want to see more about the main character and the person they eventually marry? Plus, the whole not-including-Ginny, to me at least, gave me the impression (which I hated having) that Harry simply liked Ginny because she really liked him and cared about him, not because he saw something in her. As to the wallowing in feelings, I simply didn\\'t like that because it affect me emotionally and frustrated me. What I did like: The plot was great. It didn\\'t remind me of anything I\\'d already read. I like reading something that seemed so entirely \"new\", something I couldn\\'t exactly guess every new turn. It stayed interesting and never really seemed to drag on. Powerful. GD, J.K. Rowling! First you kill Sirius Black, and if I just read that chapter correctly, Snape has just made a vow to kill freakin\\' Dumbledore? That the H? This is both the best and worst HP so far! I loved it and thought it was by far the best.....and then. Well you know what happened. I now think it is the worst (but still kind of the best. Gah!). Im so sad :( Just finished the audio book. Was very good. Though I don\\'t like the way Jim Dale does Ginny\\'s voice. But other than that, a fantastic audio book. On to Deathly Hallows! Much better. Things really took off in the end, and I liked the added romance in this one. Ready for the last book! This book is nice, but not my favorite out of all series. But still nice. \"It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world\" After reading this I need time to emotionally recuperate but at the same I need to read the last one. This book just made me feel so many FEELS. It was beautifully sorrowful, yet exciting and I JUST LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT Dumbledore dies, everybody cries So many tears. I have read a version of this that was somehow half the size, and I can say, the longer one was better. The plot was fairly good, the characters were fairly annoying. Altogether, there was way to much kissing. It was disgusting. Another excellent re-read of a favourite. Re-read october 2017: HBP has always been my least favorite of the Harry Potter novels, maybe because of the added darkness and slowness... most of the novel is about Harry trying to figure out what Draco Malfoy is up to and not being able to let it go. Though, even if it\\'s my least favorite, it still contains the magic of the HP novels. ike the continuous hinting about Snape being the Half-Blood Prince , the friendships and the magic of Hogwarts. And, one of the best sassy Harry moments of them all: There\\'s no need to call me \\'sir\\', Professor. I gave this a 9/10 for the sheer fun of enjoying reading it. For me, Harry Potter stopped being fun with the last book and it was good to get that back again. However, when I stop to think about it (or listen to my husband talking about the book), there really wasn\\'t a lot of plot here. I enjoyed at adventure, but we didn\\'t progress the overall story very far. I don\\'t want to spoil this for anyone (one major event was spoiled for me and I was very annoyed about it) which means I can\\'t really go into what I thought about some of the details, forcing this to be a particularly short review. But I guess mostly I enjoyed the story and I\\'ll wait to see if my quibbles are going to be resolved in the last book before complaining too loud. [Copied across from Library Thing; 16 October 2012] A great book continuation on the Harry Potter series. It\\'s nice that everyone believes him now, it drove me bonkers in the fifth. Even though the ending was sad, it went right with the seventh novel. OH MY CLARK GABLE I CANNOT EVEN RIGHT NOW, NO ONE TALK TO ME. Re-reading this book for the first time since it\\'s initial launch was an absolute joy. Somewhere over the years the last three Potter books had merged in my mind into an angst filled, bloated ending to the series that while still being excellent was a definite drop off from the early books. While Order Of The Phoenix confirmed this feeling The Half-Blood Prince tore it apart. Seemingly learning from some of the missteps in Phoenix, Rowling reigns things in a bit here, creating a more focused narrative while still having enough space to develop some of the relationships which come to define the series. Prince absolutely retains the magical feeling and mystery filled storytelling of the early books while telling a darker tale. While it lacks some of the social commentary from Phoenix I feel it\\'s a very worthwhile trade off. I really want to give this 1star because of the end. But I can\\'t. I just finished this and I can\\'t even write a proper review right now. This book deserves to sit in the corner and think about what it\\'s done. I\\'m just going to go cry now. Maybe for a couple of days. And Harry, YOU IDIOT. GINNY AND YOU ARE PERFECT. Hopefully Lupin got it together and came to his senses and he and Tonks will be together. Yeah. Silly, foolish Harry, thinking it was Tonks and Sirius. I never believed it. But finally, a DADA teacher has stayed! I seriously am just going to cry now. This is probably my least read Harry Potter book, and I had a really good time going through and re-reading it! I think its the perfect transion book to get us to where we need to be in book 7, without overwhelming us with too many new plot details. In fact its a much simpler story than both GoF and OOTP, but I think thats what it needed to b. I really loved going through all of Dumbledors memories again, and of course the part when they are they are in the cave always makes me shiver! This might actually top the Deathly Hallows simply because of character development. Sure, we got answers to our questions in Deathly Hallows, but this one we got to learn about Voldemort and compare him to Harry, and I love learning the origin story of the villain. Totally loved it !! My favorite volume of the series, in both book and movie. LOVE. This was simultaneously my favorite and my least favorite of the series, and this was because it seemed to be split into two entirely different books. On one side of the split, we\\'re finally getting answers about the origins of Voldemort and fleshing out the central action-plot. On the other side, it\\'s like reading a fanfic by a sixteen-year-old. One of the things I liked best about Rowling\\'s style in the earlier books was that she was able to stay above her fans\\' need for romantic focus. In the sixth book, whenever Harry wasn\\'t gallivanting through memories with Dumbledore, he and the other characters were entirely wrapped up in a Degrassi-style teenage soap opera. Frankly, it cheapened the characters I\\'d grown to love. My feelings on this book are half-and-half. I loved the Harry and Dumbledore scenes, but I could have done without the hormones. 4 1/2 Stars. Where the previous installment relies heavily on rousing emotions to propel it forward, this one relies more on rousing curiosity. The result is a nicely calm albeit lengthy bridge from the intense emotions that accompany a large chunk of the Order of the Phoenix to the intense emotions that end the Half-Blood Prince. Beyond that, I cannot say much of what I have not already said in reviews of previous books in the series. Rowling continues to constrict my heart and wring out my eyes with her emotional shockers, and her ingenious development of characters has honestly put me at a loss for words. I am all-together eager, anxious, enthusiastic, and terrified to read the final book. Wow that was so good. I still don\\'t like this one as much as the others. it honestly seemed like there were a number of different plotlines going on, which is okay, I guess, but they weren\\'t really related and they were bouncing around quite a lot. It was good that the climax held for all of them, though. Thsi book could just have easily been called \\'Harry Potter and his friend\\'s sister\\', \\'Harry Potter and Malfoy is up to SOmething\\', \\'Harry Potter and the History of Voldemort\\', \\'harry Potter and dumbledore is actually telling harry something for a change\\', \\'Harry Potter and Ron\\'s crush\\', \\'Harry potter and the quidditch cup\\', or \\'Harry Potter and Hermione is right, as usual\\'. It was about these other things just as musch as it was about teh half-Blood prince, possibly more. I admit, Harry got over many of his flaws in this one. He stopped yelling at everyone all teh time, he told people the stuff they needed to know, he stopped crushing on Cho Chang. All issues I had with him in former books. But it did seem a bit like he matured all at once. Which doesn\\'t happen. I\\'m glad he got with Ginny, though. And Ron\\'s reaction was perfect. I would have liked a little more showing what actually happened, there was a lot of \"this week was great\", \"he was thinking about a nice hour he had spent\" \"he was very happy\"...etc. I would have liked a little more of it actually happening and a little less telling in retrospect. I was dissapointed in this climax. Not only was it dissapointing no matter how well it was written, but i was dissapointed in the futileness of the Horcrux thing. Also i thought that the climax was odly detached form the rest of the book. it was kind of llike \"Oh lets go have a climax...GO\" It didn\\'t even try to ease into it. plus it bugs me that everyone is wrong, becasue i like there to be someone that is right in teh story, but when Harry, Hermione, and Professor McGonagall are all wrong, there is something going on. One Note: This sounds naive. but why doesn\\'t The portrait of Dumbledore count for anything? Don\\'t portraits have memories, knowledge, and the ability to talk? Can\\'t Dumbledore\\'s Portrait just keep on being headmaster and giveing harr his lessons? What is the difference??? I am having issues with this. One rant: IT IS NEVER SNAPE!!!! WHEN WILL THE ENTIRE CAST GET THIS THROUGH THEIR THICK SKULLS?? and why couldn\\'t there at least be one person who is still sure he\\'s good. That would ahve been better. I wish Hermione\\'s and Ron\\'s stupid arguments didnt\\' have to last entire books. That is not realistic. If you stay mad at eachother that long, you aren\\'t making up. This was like 7 months, which is amplified in Boarding school time. It doesn\\'t work like that. And why are they both so stupid and selfish. They need to be there for Harry!! They are causing him just one more source of anxiety that he sure as heck doesn\\'t need right now. They need to buck up and be there for Harry, whether they are besties or not. Or jsut fall in love already. That would be good too. Is there a difference between a hex, a curse, and a jinx? because I thought they were all sort of slightly different, distinct things, but they seem to be used interchangebly. Apparently I read this pretty quickly? Well, there\\'s a reason for that: it was great! It totally redeemed the last book, as this novel was far more exciting, had less aggravating characters, and it wasn\\'t as depressing as its predecessor (ok, the ending actually made me sad, I will admit, though I knew it was coming before I even read the series). There was one aspect of the novel that made me scoff quite a few times, and that was the teenage drama. Now, not to say that I wasn\\'t the same way when I was in high school (you know, shy to ask someone out, obsessing over the one tiny smile the cute guy gave me), but when you\\'re 27, like I am, you just want to tell 16-year-olds to \"ASK THEM OUT FOR LOVE OF ZEUS\". Seriously, it\\'s not a big deal at all. Hell, when you\\'re my age you can tell if someone wants in your pants just by catching their eye and raising an eyebrow. But when you\\'re 16, it is a big deal to tell someone you fancy them. And Rowling did a great job making their little dramas entirely realistic and therefore endearing. I think there was just enough of the drama to make Harry and friends out to be typical teenagers (because if they were all stoics and not interested in making out it would be laughably unrealistic), but not enough that I shook the book and was like \"ENOUGH ALREADY.\" h, and I totally called Tonks being in love with Lupin , but that\\'s probably because I have a wee crush on him myself! ANYWAY, drama aside, the book moved at a great pace. Clearly I couldn\\'t put it down. Likewise, the last hundred pages was a great climax - a mystery was solved, another mystery was introduced, a battle took place... and as such, it was a really good precursor to the last book. Hell, I\\'m going to start Deathly Hallows as soon as I\\'m done work. A couple things were a little obvious. The identity of the Half-Blood Prince? igured that out from the get-go (I mean, come on, who else would have the time [due to having no friends] to annotate an entire book, and who else grew up to become the POTIONS professor? ). And despite what he did, this particular character still tugs on my heartstrings. I wish I had read this series years ago. This may be my favorite Harry Potter book. I love the sections with Voldemort\\'s backstory - they really help you understand him. Learning about the Horcruxes is really shocking, for the reader as much as Harry. It\\'s nice to see Harry and Dumbledore\\'s trust in each other grow (sob). I also like that everyone finally pairs up in this book, even if it\\'s after some angst (the Ron and Lavender scenes always make me laugh). The mystery of the identity of the half-blood prince - and the reveal at the end - also elevate the book, as does the tension-filled climax in the cave. And of course, the end is just so sad. It still breaks my heart, even after having reread it many times. The book does a good job setting up everything for the grand finale! #cryingrealtears It\\'s still not easy to read this even when you know it\\'s coming because you\\'ve read it before...multiple times.... Re-reading before the Cursed Child\\'s release on 7/31/16! ** spoiler alert ** Heartbreaking and Fabulous (Best BOOK,WORST movie) +Half-Blood Prince is my favorite book and other than 7, the darkest book in the series. though each is a masterpiece. Full of great moments in the story. I felt that I was learning more and at a quicker rate than in Order of the Phoenix. +It must be that Rowling, in her grand scheme, is saving much for the last book. One thing seems to be for certain, though, and that is that J.K. Rowling will never lose that special touch, that supreme and genuine interest in the story and its characters that makes the writing so engrossing. After completing this book, I was in a state of total shock and to this moment I wish only to read the seventh book. +Half-Blood Prince is dark; I mean far darker than the last. Several of the chapters are particularly well-written, with great suspense and imagery;Relationships blossom in this book at last, haha i will not TELL,BUT i was engrossed in Harry\\'s LOVE LIFE,at the same time disappointed haha LOL because it\\'s a bit short,not just Harry\\'s LOVE STORY but other CHARACTERS as well. +Much of the book is devoted to Harry witnessing important memories in the Pensieve with Dumbledore so that he can gain a greater understanding of his enemy, the Dark Lord. +Revealing more on SNAPE\\'S story.hmmm,i\\'m a bit fan of Severus Snape,though i HATE him for DOiNG SOMETHING REALLY REALLY BAD & unexpected, T_T RESULTiNG of MOST SHOCKING PART of this book.One of the MAiN CHARACTER DIED.I was so sad & teary-eyed,to the point i READ again that part not believing it really happened. I was expecting a surprising reason for Dumbledore to trust Snape, not a simple apology. There must still be more to this than meets the eye. +The end of the book is unbelievably sad and depressing.When you grow with Harry Potter it\\'s definitely a blast. +If you haven\\'t guessed my opinion on \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" yet, I\\'ll say that I highly recommend it. Run to get your copy, if you don\\'t already have one, and share the magic :) +LASTLY, +\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" is amazing. It is mature and moving and is by far the best book in the series so far. There are a lot of open-ended questions that are leading up to Book Seven...will Harry and his friends return to Hogwarts for their final year? Will there even be a Hogwarts to go back to? How on earth will Harry manage the impossible task that lies ahead of him? One thing\\'s for certain...I can\\'t wait to find out! Blimey!! Let\\'s READ the LAST PART of the BOOK Shall we??? or not?? ** spoiler alert ** This might be my favorite in the series, but the jury is out on that since I\\'ve read the last one only once, and I flew through it so fast I can barely remember parts of it. As for this book, the snogging stuff gets a little annoying, but the overall story is great. This book also has my favorite scene in the series which is where Snape hands Harry his ass in a duel. Snape is probably my favorite character in the series overall, and he\\'s featured rather prominently in this one. Reread the ending and it kills me every time... 7th book of 2017 - (5 stars) ~finished february 8, 2017~ still great :) update: february 8, 2017 honestly still don\\'t understand why people didn\\'t love this book. i loooooooved it <3 also the goodreads rereading function-thanks :) update: march 6, 2016: reading this series again in the wrong order makes me happy :) HP re-read 2015. This is one of my faves in the series. And still brings me to tears. Probably the best of the Potter books. Cried at the end all over again. Maybe it\\'s the Harry Potter Book with biggest revelation and maddest turn of event. Personally, I will always think of this book as the account of Harry\\'s last year in Hogwarts. This book is when I feel like the series started to take a majorly dark turn. It\\'s so intense and depressing at some points (you all know exactly which part it is too) but as with all of the books, it still keeps me enthralled and wanting more. Just great, adored this books like the others. Harry Potter will always be a series that I\\'ll never get tired of rereading and this is only the second time I read it, the first time was in French, my native language. (I\\'m not an English-speaking don\\'t hesitate to correct me if needs be) Reread Sept. Harry goes about this tome with: Malfoy-Ginny-Prince-Malfoy-Quiddich-Prince-Malfoy-Ginny-Quidditch-Voldemort\\'s origin story-Teen Angst-Quiddich-Ginny-Malfoy... And in the usual JKR style, last 5 chapters is where things happen and end. Sept 4, 2017 - finished on audio. This one went very fast (also helped along by a road trip), and Jim Dale got to do many characters in younger form during flashbacks. The whole last couple hours of this were so harrowing. \"And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour--or possibly several sunlit days--they broke apart.\" [Harry thinks] how they had talked about fighting a losing battle, and that it was important to fight, and to fight again, and to keep fighting, to keep evil at bay, though never quite eradicated. \"Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!\" \"There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to fear from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" July 2007-ish: Okay, I\\'m now at the point everyone else was at when they couldn\\'t wait for midnight on July 21!! Although I\\'d already heard who dies at the end of this 6th book, I managed not to hear how it happens, and I was shocked -- shocked! This story is getting really scary (for a wimp like me), and certain scenes I wished I wasn\\'t reading alone at night! But lucky me, I get to open book 7 RIGHT NOW and not wait two years for closure! Here goes... You know. It\\'s just good. Favorite Quotes Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths. Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. This is me now. Of course I don\\'t have a Damon - shoulder to cry on but still... So far this is my favourite HP book. It was so good, such a fast read and it made me laugh cringe and cry. I am so sad that my journey is almost over. But hey I have book 8 soon. I can\\'t believe I am onto book 7 already. Full review to come Oh and poor Hagrid and Fang. I hope all works out fine( hopefully) o sad on Dumbledore\\'s death. o sad.  can\\'t. nape I hate you. hocked about Harry and Ginny emus and Tanks??!! re-read. I dislike Harry and Ginny getting together. One second he thinks her name and suddenly he likes her? I don\\'t get it. Besides that, everything else was wonderful Buddy Re-Read continues! I read this last almost the day after it originally came out and was amazed at the big reveals... Guess who Dies and guess who the Prince is! ... but more than that, I was pretty blah and then very enthused as we learned more and more and more and more about Mr. Riddle as Harry kept sticking his head under water. It was a hate/love relationship for me. I wanted to know about our big bad. I really did. And then I also wanted to just get over all the cleverly-installed flashbacks and get on with the freaking story. That was before the movie. And so the movie came out and I was all like... Where is all the backstory for Voldemort? This is hardly anything! This is just a brief little taste! How are we supposed to feel the deep revulsion AND pity for the man if we can\\'t get more screen time for him??? And so I fell BACK on the bandwagon for all those pretty flashbacks. Ah, the trials and tribulations of a fanboy. This is like knowing Frank Herbert\\'s Dune inside and out and then watching the Lynch mindf*** and spending more than 3/4 of the movie filling in all the details that are left unsaid in the film that make the story deeper and more amazing than the acid trip that I was watching. Okay. Maybe the HP6 film wasn\\'t QUITE that bad and there were a lot of brilliant moments that were visual and direct link-ups to the main plot in the HP7 movies, so continuity was preserved very well. Still, the lack of time with Snape\\'s younger cursecrafting self and the lack of all the mystery subplot with Dumbledore, himself, made the end events kind of rushed and confusing within the movie. Not so at all within the book. The book was a real page-turner for me. Again. I love in-depth reasons. A lot. Still a great book! Reread January 2017 It\\'s been quite a long time since I\\'ve reread this book and there was so much about it that I had faint remembrance of that when I got to it felt like a breath of fresh air reading. The last time I read this I remember it hadn\\'t been one of my favorites for some reason but now that I\\'m revisiting it after some time I absolutely loved this one! Granted, I love every Harry Potter book but this is the first time I\\'ve read this one in a while and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Actual Rating: 4.5 Yeesh. This book was really, really close to not getting 5 stars, and while that sounds fine for any other book, this is Harry Potter we\\'re talking about here. It\\'s not supposed to be close to getting 4 stars. The ending was enough to satisfy me, though, because of... well, you know what. Just because of that, this book managed to sneak past and retain the record. I\\'m not going to let up too easy on the last book, though -- I generally have high expectations of conclusions. I remember from my first read-through of this series that I thought of the two final books as very unsatisfying, compared to the first five. Apparently I still think that, because I had two major issues with this book. One, it was on a bit of a rinse-and-repeat schedule. Everybody knows that\\'s not how Harry Potter goes. It\\'s supposed to be unexpected, and you\\'re not supposed to know what\\'s going to come up next. Two, the characters were starting to grate on my nerves. Like, seriously? Why do Ron and Hermione have to keep shifting back and forth? First they\\'re fine with each other, and then they hate each other so much they make purposeful moves so as not to even look at the other? Then suddenly they\\'re fine again? I get that \"teenage relationships\" go back and forth a lot, but seriously. Ron is so annoying. I\\'m sorry, but he is. I seriously want to punch him in the face. On the other hand, Dumbledore was my favorite character in this book. I\\'m well aware that J.K. Rowling was probably just building up angst because of what happens to him later... but still. He was a well-developed character in this book, and a character that rarely ever irritated me. And for that, I thank him. Also, the book was just so boring. As I previously stated, it was on a rinse-and-repeat schedule. Ron and Hermione either get into a fight or make amends. Things are mentioned about the \"Half-Blood Prince\", or classes. Then there\\'s another lesson with Dumbledore. Then brief things about Voldemort. Sometimes you get the occasional Quidditch. (Speaking of which, we played Quidditch in P.E. Monday. I was so hyped.) Then Ron and Hermione have another intense confrontation/conversation. Things are mentioned once again about the Half-Blood Prince, either that, or it\\'s something about Slughorn. Then we have brief mentions of how hard classes are. And we have another lesson with Dumbledore, which sends Harry into some brief state of euphoria. When I say brief, I mean brief. And then after that, people discuss about Voldemort, or something major centering either Voldemort or the Ministry of Magic is announced. (Yes, I consider Stan Shunpike\\'s arrest \"major\".) It just goes on... and on... and on... But there is a reason why it\\'s rated 5 stars. First of all, it really shows well the time of war going on. It shows how even in wartimes, life continues, and while I haven\\'t really experienced it, I can tell it from this book. There\\'s romance. There\\'s Fred and George\\'s popular wizard jokes shop, which is getting many customers even though the most powerful Dark wizard of all time is back. Alas, I still wish that we discussed more about the Order of the Phoenix (I mean, come on, last book was named after them), but I guess you can\\'t have everything. Too bad some of my favorite characters are in the Order of the Phoenix... Also, I found the ending incredible. I powered right through the ending, and it was so wonderfully written in a way that tugged at your heartstrings. Pretty decent book, I suppose. However, there\\'s a bit of a sour taste in my mouth from it, and I really only gave it 5 stars due to my reverie of the previous books. 4.5/5 it\\'s become better upon each reread, but I still think too much teen drama/romance bogged down the novel. Narcissa and Snape are the reasons why I rate the book so highly. I definitely appreciate Narcissa more now in hindsight, as well as Draco. ah, the cover... pensieve. Once again - so sad, yet so brilliant. The pacing was perfect, the plot was great, the characters are all amazing in their own way (aside, obviously, from Umbridge, even though she only appeared in about two sentences in this book), and J.K. Rowling is a genius. That is really all I have to say right now. I\\'m a little scared to start the final book, knowing what will come; but at the same time, I can\\'t wait to go on. I\\'m a little torn. (Knowing myself, I\\'ll be starting the next book tonight, anyway, or tomorrow at the earliest.) Merlin\\'s beard.... this book is definitely... Now I know why so many people say that J.K. Rowling is a living legend. She really knows her stuff. Warning: Spoilers are present in this review It was easier for me to immediately get into the central story in this one, mainly because Harry has stopped being as moody as he was in the Order of Phoenix, and that in itself made me like the sixth installment in this series more. I think that The Half Blood Prince might be my favorite one so far (just behind it is The Prisoner of Azkaban). I can\\'t really say why, but there was something that kept me so immersed in it that I had to stay up late to finish. That\\'s not to say that the others don\\'t possess the same quality - but even so, I felt it more here. It could just be the fact that I enjoyed the subplots more.Normally I don\\'t like it when there\\'s a lot of memories and flashbacks in a book, but J.K. Rowling unfolds everything so skillfully as always, and learning about Voldemort\\'s past was quite interesting to me. I suppose he had a bad childhood, so that could have contributed to his evilness, but overall I think he\\'s just crazy. It also answered something that had been puzzling me since the beginning of the Goblet of Fire - I didn\\'t get how three Riddles were murdered in their big house. But with the explanation midway into the novel it all made sense. I\\'ve learned to just go with the flo when it comes to the Harry Potter books, knowing that eventually I\\'ll have no more questions to ask. I always felt like Harry was right to keep such a close eye on Draco throughout his sixth year at Hogwarts, especially after everything he heard on the train. I found it a little odd that Ron and Hermione dismissed Harry\\'s serious suspicions about Draco so easily with the evidence that steadily kept piling up. I was surprised at the turn his character took, honestly. He\\'s always been a pest, yes, and definitely a worthy enemy of Harry\\'s, ever since the first book. Still, I was sad when he started working with the Death Eaters, and by the end of HP number six, I felt really bad for him. He probably felt like he had no choice, what with his whole family being on Voldemort\\'s side. That doesn\\'t excuse his actions, though. I\\'m curious to see what will become of him in the last one. I can honestly say that the HP books have the best secondary characters of any series I\\'ve ever read (and that\\'s quite a statement, coming from me. I like to think I\\'ve read a lot.) Almost all of them have made some kind of impression on me, whether they were good or bad. For example, I kind of love Luna, even though she hasn\\'t been around a whole lot, and was just introduced in the last book. She may be a little odd, but she has this open way of stating things; I\\'m really hoping for some kind of happy ending for her. All the Weasleys will always have a special place in my heart. I was, however, kind of surprised by Harry\\'s feelings for Ginny. They seemed to spring up very suddenly. I mean, they\\'ve known each other for over five years and he just now realizes that she\\'s pretty and awesome. I got used to it after a while, but I kind of wish the relationship had a little more development. I was really disappointed at first because Ginny was really quiet, and as close to a flat character as you can get in the HP books. But she actually showed some personality here, much more fiery than before. I was annoyed when Harry broke up with her at the end. It was obvious that Voldemort would use whoever Harry cared about against him, but he could just as easily use Ron or Hermione, and I didn\\'t see him ditching them. In both the books and the movies, I have seen tiny hints of feelings between Ron and Hermione. I think that they came out a lot more in this one. It was obvious after Hermione\\'s temper tantrum with the birds when Ron got together with Lavender (who was extremely annoying). On one hand I felt kind of bad for the both of them, but on the other I\\'ve gotten to the point where I\\'m just really frustrated with their dance-around-the-feelings thing. I think they\\'re pretty cute together, though I do wonder sometimes what made Rowling decide not to put two of her main characters together. The most heart-stopping, punch in the gut was definitely the end when Dumbledore died. I had some suspicion of it happening based off some comments I\\'d read in some reviews, but I was hoping against hope I was wrong and it wouldn\\'t happen. I had come to care for him so much as a character in this series that I was simply devastated upon reading about his demise. I actually had to put the book aside for a few minutes so I could cry about it; he was so wise and friendly, yet so powerful. I didn\\'t expect Draco to be the one to kill him in the tower based on the way he was already acting (he was crying earlier in the bathroom, after all), but I also didn\\'t think Snape would be the one to do it. Obviously I\\'ve always disliked him for his behavior towards Harry, but I was hoping he had really changed (though maybe some part of me thought he didn\\'t, even though five years had gone by without him murdering Harry). And the fact that Snape was the Half Blood Prince? I probably should have seen that coming, what with all the advice he gave coming out of a Potions book, but I really didn\\'t. I still don\\'t feel like I completely understand Snape\\'s character, but as of now I hate him for killing Dumbledore. This book was an excellent set-up for the final chapter, and though I want to put off reading it because it\\'s the last one, I know I won\\'t because I just have to see how this all ends immediately. I was just really annoyed with Dumbledore in this one Oh my gosh so many damn emotions this book. - We learn how and why Voldemort has been capable of living after going through so much. Horcruxs which contain small fragments of Voldemorts soul in each of them. We must destroy all the Horcruxs in order to destroy Voldemort!  The battle at Hogwarts...SO MANY FEELS. t first Dumbledore being brutally murdered by freaking SNAPE. ever should\\'ve trusted that many. nly for Hagrids hut to catch on fire and for Fang to nearly die! Such an intense scene. - Fleur and Bills love after the accident. The way the Weasleys finally realized that Fleur is more than just her appearance and that her love for Bill runs deep. They\\'re no longer teenagers dealing with mundane things. Voldemort is growing stronger as well as his following of death eaters. The books are taking a darker turn as the end is nearing. The students are all growing older and taking on more serious aspects of life. *sobs uncontrollably* Why yes it was a great book. The first time I read this book, I really didn\\'t like it that much. But ironically when I watched all the movies, this one was my favorite. So I think knowing that I enjoyed this movie the most, I actually ended up enjoying this book a lot more. eading Dumbledore\\'s death still made me super sad, but it was easier to get through this time around.  just remember being really shocked by it the first time. eing prepared really helped soften the blow from his death. I\"m glad I finally got around to reading this again so I can give it the appreciation it actually deserves. OMG, the ending always makes me cry! Could not put this down and a great improvement from length of the 5th novel in the series. Much less going on and much more to the point. #3 is still my favourite book but this would be a close second! Dark, witty and fairly fast paced, your left with thrills and hangers but they are resolved within a reasonable amount of time. The dashes of romance and humour add to a very gritty addition to the series. I cant wait to finish the final book. NOT ready for this reread to be over. I\\'m not sure when I\\'ll get to the 7th book but dammit these books are just as fantastic years later. (Duh.) Current favorites in order: 4,3,1,6,5,2 (I have a feeling 7 will fall towards the middle - I remember being bored during all the walking but the middle/end GAH) The great thing about rereading is that you visit a time in your life when you thought differently. For a long time I thought that Half-Blood Prince was my favorite of the Harry Potter books and now, 10 years later, as I read this one I loved it. I really really loved it, it\\'s a 5 star read but now I\\'m not sure if I can still call this my favorite of the Harry Potter books. I almost love The Order of the Phoenix more which is hilarious to me especially since for a long time OOtP was my least favorite of the books. It just shows you how we change. I had forgotten about 60% of what happens in this book so I have decided that I need to read the Harry Potter books every 3-4 years. I still laugh at the jokes and everything felt fresh and modern, these books have aged to incredibly well. I also have to commend Rowling for her \\'growing up\\' of Harry in this book as this is the book when Harry faces down the Minister of Magic all by himself with plenty of sass to go around. I had also forgotten just how awesome Ginny is, when Ginny came to the forefront of the books she was met with a lot of backlash - she was a sharp contrast to beloved Hermione which I felt was incredibly unfair to her since Rowling had YEARS to flesh out Hermione and since the books are told in Harry\\'s POV he just doesn\\'t notice Ginny until this book so we notice her as Harry notices her. The Mary-Sue term was stamped on her something fierce (a term I find both insulting and sexist). Rowling has such an uncanny ability to write female characters, even if all they get is a few lines, Tonks, Luna, Fleur and Mrs. Malfoy are a few that come to mind. I\\'m a little sad that I\\'m coming to the end of the books, I\\'ve enjoyed the reread so much and in these crazy political times they have been my happy place which I am incredibly grateful for. I knew what was coming. I knew what would happen. But I still cried. I insanely cried while I was in the bus travelling home. And I didn\\'t care. BRB, STILL CRYING. It all gets so sad and serious. *sobs* This book was awesome. I can\\'t believe all that is happening. I still see Harry, Hermione and Ron as 11 year olds but they aren\\'t and I\\'m dying to read the next book. I like how this series has gone from feeling like a simple story to being so involved and darker. You have to know it will become dark because of the premise of the story. I really love this telling of the classic good vs. evil. Reread ** spoiler alert ** Okay, okay, okay, let me get my thoughts together. First off, I have never cried so much because of a book. I was able to prevent myself from crying up until the funeral. I knew Dumbledore had died in this book but I was denying that it would happen. I just... people can still like Snape? I know in Deathly Hallows, Snape will probably say, \"I had to convince the Death Eaters that I was on their side, Dumbledore would\\'ve proudly died for this cause!\" I\\'m still in half-denial. On a lighter note, I have so many questions. First and foremost, I have been spoiled that Harry is a Horcrux, and I know the answer will be in Deathly Hallows, but... how? Won\\'t he have to destroy himself? Plus, who the heck is the person who has the locket? (I was so anxious throughout that scene; I felt that Dumbledore would die because there weren\\'t enough pages left in the book for it to be otherwise.) Side note: I volunteer to throw Draco Malfoy into the sun (and no, I would not like \"redeeming\" things to happen in Deathly Hallows. I don\\'t care if he fights against Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts.) I\\'m just now realizing how spoiled I have been for this series. I know the outcome of all the relationships, the whole series, characters\\' lives (I wasn\\'t aware of Snape\\'s until about a week ago), etc. In spite of all that, I\\'m still somehow loving this series. Again, after Deathly Hallows I hope I know whether it is my favorite series ever. This is the first Harry Potter book that I have read in a normal amount of time (all of them have previously taken me 1 day, a week, or two weeks to finish) so I feel like completing this in 4 days contributes to how much I loved this book (even though I obviously would have loved it just as much.) Again, as a reference point to future Savannah: you just sat and read this book for about 6 hours in 2 hour segments in your last 2 days of reading it. I don\\'t really have anything else to say. I just. Wow. Ugh this book still makes me cry, years later. I cannot believe how the book ends -- or what I know what will happen in the future. Re-read #??? completed 12/6/14 (1st re-read via audiobook):  Well. It\\'s so interesting to see how much my opinion has either stayed the same or changed with my re-read after so many years. The Half-Blood Prince was one of my favorites since the last time I read it (at least 5 years ago if not 10. Clearly I was not good at keeping track) and I think it\\'s safe to say that it\\'s still my favorite of the entire series. I love everything that happens with Harry\\'s knowledge and seeking of information about how Lord Voldemort is as well as the fact that the book still largely takes place at school (I still love book seven but the fact that Hogwarts is mostly missing is something that I really did miss from the book). It may be in part since I realized that I actually haven\\'t seen the movie in forever so the book was really in the forefront of my mind instead of the movie version of events... I also am not a huge fan of movie Ginny and she still feels very much like a secondary character in this book still but she\\'s starting to really have more of a presence. I tried to put movie Ginny out of my mind and it helped a bit (poor Bonnie) and the relationship between Harry and Ginny in the book is SOOOOOO much more natural than in the movies. Anyway. Love the information we get in this book. Still solidly one of my favorites -- no wait. My actual favorite -- of the series. Full review posted HERE on The Book Addict\\'s Guide 1/23/15: ** There WILL be spoilers for this book (and the final book) so if you haven\\'t read it yet, BEWARE. You\\'re gonna get spoiled! I felt a bit of pressure before starting HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. It\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve re-read all of the books but I always claimed this one as my favorite of the series. After realizing how much my opinion of ORDER OF THE PHOENIX had changed, I was totally unsure of how HBP would go. Right off the bat, though, I was still in love. I just love how this book really brings everything to the next level -- from the plot to the adventure, Quidditch to romances -- everything just gets bigger and better in HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. I think one of my favorite things about it is the introduction to Horcruxes. I just really love the layers that it adds to the plot and how it adds another sense of adventure for the characters. I also really, really love that we get to know more about the villain\\'s past. I LOVE when the reader gets to know more about the villain and his backstory. I think it adds so much to a book and even makes that villain a bit more human -- whether that\\'s by a little or a lot. We all know how amazing J.K. Rowling is at her world building in these books so I guess I should never be surprised but that really is one of my favorite things about the entire series. I really wasn\\'t big on many of the romances in this series. For me, Harry Potter was always more about action, adventure, friendship, learning, and well... magic. Movie Ginny kind of ruined book Ginny for me so I was really trying to give book Ginny another shot since I know where this story goes... I felt like she actually wasn\\'t hugely present in HALF-BLOOD PRINCE still so I didn\\'t feel like I had the opportunity to be bothered or charmed by her. She did make many appearances at the Slug Club parties and Quidditch matches, etc but for some reason I still felt like she wasn\\'t a very big character... I\\'m really interested to see how I feel about her in book seven because so far reading the books, I still don\\'t feel a lot! I do, of course, love the Ron and Hermione romance. You know I love best friendships turning into something more and this was a long time coming. It\\'s really interesting to see how this tension has slowly built and comes to its breaking point at the end of HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. As always, I love the layers upon layers of world building. From getting to know more about Voldemort to the different classes the students take to the different places they visit... I just love getting lost in this world and something about the writing just makes me feel like it\\'s a real place, just out of my reach. I always love learning more about magic and what the rules are and what the limitations are. The Felix Felicis chapter is still one of my favorites and the cave scene at the end still creeps me out a lot. Then of course we have Dumbledore\\'s death. I\\'m not sure why -- maybe I know the books/movies too well? -- but I never really feel shaken by the deaths in these books (except for probably Fred, oh god, how will I read that) so I really didn\\'t get too worked up over his death... But I think for Dumbledore, it doesn\\'t really feel like he\\'s gone, you know? His portrait is in the headmaster\\'s office and we know he sort of... appears to Harry in the final book too. It\\'s Dumbledore. He\\'s the greatest wizard of all time. He may be dead but only kind of? The great news is that HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE still stands as my favorite of the series so far! I was never able to place my love for the final book so it\\'ll be interesting to see where I come out on this re-read! Ranking after re-read of book #1: [1] // [6, 4, 5, 7, 3, 2] Ranking after re-read of book #2: [1, 2] // [6, 4, 5, 7, 3] Ranking after re-read of book #3: [3, 1, 2] // [6, 4, 5, 7] Ranking after re-read of book #4: [4, 3, 1, 2] // [6, 5, 7] Ranking after re-read of book #5: [4, 3, 1, 5, 2] // [6, 7] Ranking after re-read of book #6: [6, 4, 3, 1, 5, 2] // [7] Good book. I liked it much more than the fifth book I think. Harry starts to come into his own and scene is finally set for the finale. Seventh book here I come. With Harry\\'s occlumency lessons with Professor Snape a resounding failure, he begins lessons with Dumbledore instead. Together, they explore memories collected by Dumbledore in an attempt to better understand Lord Voldemort. Meanwhile, Harry has found an old textbook filled with the notes of the previous owner - known only as the Half-Blood Prince. The notes help Harry excel in his Potions class, but after the encounter with the evil book in The Chamber of Secrets, Hermione has some reservations about using such a powerful book. There was some interesting play with morality in this volume. Not to give too much away for the three people left on earth who haven\\'t read the series yet, but Harry has to cause harm to someone he loves for the greater good. It\\'s an extremely powerful scene that marks the tone for the rest of the series. Seriously, I was bawling. This book is the Empire Strikes Back of the series. This book........ It has broken me. I don\\'t think I will ever be the same. Dumbledore I NEED YOU! You just can\\'t be gone...... No No Noooo:( Snape and that little piece of shit Malfoy will pay with their lives. Even though I know that\\'s not what you would want. DUMBLEDORE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Holy big-sobbing mess, Batman. *sniffle* I liked it more than Harry Potter 4 and 5. Harry was so nice in this one. but didn\\'t have a great story like the first three books. Review to come. This one made me sad. But.... Hello? Its Harry Freaking Potter!! ***SPOILER ALERT!!! Harry continues to mature, his understanding of the world continues to grow in sophistication, and the battle between the good and evil forces grows ever more perilous. The plot moves forward toward the ultimate confrontation between Harry and his nemesis. Voldemort\\'s character grows ever darker. Harry looses a valuable ally. In between, he learns more about magic, shows up Hermione, and develops a romantic entanglement. The writing is crisp and moves along quickly. The minute I began to read the book, my heart couldn\\'t stop beating, my eyes couldn\\'t stop reading, and my hands couldn\\'t put the book down. Unfortunately, I saw the movie before reading the book. (yes I know, never judge the book by the movie) well, I might have to say, it\\'s true. You should read the book before watching the movie just because in the book it has more details and the movie will just make you cry and not understand the whole point. He fought, somebody dies, and everybody cries. But the book tells you so much more...You\\'ll just have to read it if you haven\\'t read it yet. Reading this again just reminds me how badly they screwed up the movie. first read jan 2015 second read 27/01/2017-01/02/2017 So I watch the movie before reading the book (Yes you may wonder why I do such horrible thing). The thing is I used to not like reading especially big book or series like Harry Potter !! I just read and finished Harry Potter last year. I decided to read it because of my bucket list. I must finish Harry Potter before going to college. And I did and I loved it. Everything is just magical. (This is not my first fantasy series/trilogy though). I literally inhaled this book the first time through. I enjoyed it much better the second time through, just this past summer. I swear I didn\\'t read the ending the first time through as this time it was like reading it for the first time. Finished reading this book in just half a day! Still my favourite Harry Potter book by far. It\\'s the perfect balance between action, information and down time. A true masterpiece in literature! Another great Harry Potter book! I felt really really awful when Dumbledore died. it was as if someone I knew in real life really did pass on. I\\'ve gotten attached to the old coot. I also felt a little bit of hopelessness. I thought all was lost when Dumbledore passed away. thank goodness for Harry... although he was a little helpless at first. this book gave me the strength to believe in Harry. the belief that he really could defeat the dark lord. This one was hard for me to get into and it started off really slow, but the ending was like BAM! The last hundred or so pages had me curled in a ball and holding my breath as I read. It was worth the slow start! I\\'m going to review these as a series since it\\'s been awhile since I read them. Just know that Deathly Hollows was by far my favorite. The series starts off slow and relatively innocent but really picks up the pace around book 3 - The Prisoner of Azkaban. The writing is spot-on, never lulling the reader into a detail-ridden coma, but instead begging to be read late into the night. These books are so well-written and enjoyable and perfect for re-reads. Really good. I loved it. I love all these books though... lol. eally neat to finally learn more about Professor Snape though.  liked that you find out how awesome he is at potions . he love stories took a turn  in this one too. It played the story well, and was so full of information i was dying to finish the book! This is my most favorite book of the whole HP series. This book was a roller coaster ride of emotions, drama, mystery and tragedy for me as a potterhead. For me, this is the best book of JK Rowling up to date. Oh hey, Ginny Weasley has an ACTUAL PERSONALITY. ** spoiler alert ** I loved this book as one of my favorite books. I really hate the part where Dumbledore dies though because its so sad. The fact about how the Horxrux wasn\\'t even real though and Dumbledore died for it is even more sad. I cried so hard in this book :( After the letdown of \\'Order of the Phoenix\\', I was happy to realize that I was really enjoying the writing and mystery of this edition detailing Year #6 at Hogwarts. Harry\\'s Spells class runs out of new \\'recipe\\' books, so an old book that was lying around in the closet. The book was previously owned by somebody named Prince. Prince added many notes to the brewing of the spells, and whenever Harry followed these additional instructions, his concoctions always succeeded. Who was this Half-Blood Prince? I had many theories, including Harry\\'s mother, but was wrong on all of them. She fooled me on this one and it was good choice what makes all the sense in the world once revealed. Very good. I liked this book all the way to the very end where things really started to fall apart for me. Dumbledore drinking all of that lagoon water which made him dipsy made no sense to me and seemed completely out of character. And for what? They didn\\'t find the key to destroying Voldermort. Only a clue to another person who is out for Voldermort with the initials R. A. B. Isn\\'t it a little late in the series to be introducing new mysteries and characters like this? Yet another Major character is killed off. I felt this was more for shock value than anything else and it all seemed so meaningless. And most disturbing to me... Harry quits school! What kind of message is this for children? A frustrating last couple of chapters. Stephen King says:\"The miracle of the Harry Potter series is that it keeps getting better. The genius of Ms. Rowling was her decision (probably never even seriously considered at the time) to follow Harry through his schooling. As a result, Harry\\'s fans have never left him behind. The question is whether Ms. Rowling will be bound to him for life, as Arthur Conan Doyle was bound to Sherlock Holmes.\" He recommended audiobook, too. I loved them all! Read \\'em twice! I...I can\\'t even begin to describe my thoughts on this installment. This book had the Hogwarts charm the earlier books had that was absolutely amazing. The characters have grown so much. They have all become wonderful people that i genuinely care about. Harry especially. You can really tell he grew in this book. He\\'s less arrogant and can control his temper somewhat. I can\\'t decide which character is my favorite though. All of them are awesome or are fun to hate. The ending killed me though. I am not okay. I am in awe of how Rowling created this magical world that never gets boring. I have seen all the movies but yet I was still shocked and hurt and happy every chapter. (The movie does not do the ending of the book justice except for the wands scene in the movie) Rowling really knows how to write. Every book gets more fascinating as you turn the pages. My favorite part was the scene that Harry learned about Voldemort\\'s past. They were so interesting. I cannot believe it is almost over. I don\\'t know how Harry Potter fans dealt with it. I\\'m not sure if I can get to the last book. I cannot believe I only have one more book left. Harry Potter fans had to deal with it longer than I have though. I get it now. I get the fuss. I can\\'t pick a favorite book from the series but this is up there. Wow Reread fueled by watching the movie and reading some quality fic. You\\'ve all heard of the book. If you haven\\'t read it yet & don\\'t want anything spoiled, don\\'t read beyond the cut. All I\\'ll say is that if you\\'ve read the first five books of course you\\'re going to get around to reading eventually and once you finish Half Blood Prince you\\'ll eagerly await the publication of the seventh book in the series. Grad school kept me from finishing it until now, so I\\'m sure I\\'m probably the only one who hasn\\'t read it yet. Anyway, Since I\\'ve gotten into writing these reviews for more general reasons & I\\'m really not anywhere near the biggest HP buff out there, I\\'m not going to get into debates about who R.A.B. is, whether Dumbledore is really dead, or what in the world Snape is up to. I\\'ve never known anyone to acurately predict such things, so while I don\\'t mind a little idle speculation, I\\'m not going to devote any serious energy to figuring out something that Rowling will inevitably explain much more creatively and entertainingly than I could. Two things that I\\'ve loved about the HP series that I think Half Blood Prince continued to do: Rowling has continued to fulfill her promise of making sure that the style of the books mature with Harry. Ayear older and wiser than the moody teenager in Order of the Phoenix, Harry\\'s realizes there are more important things than getting pissed off at the world. He\\'s still a 16-year-old boy, though, so it\\'s not surprising that he gets frustrated with Dumbledore for not telling him everything right away, but I\\'m glad to see that he\\'s calmed down a little bit. Even while dealing with more and more intricate plot details, or maybe because of that, Rowling still manages to craft a very great mystery, leading us one way, and in the end, showing us that it\\'s really something completely different. For example, with all the talk about werewolves and Draco\\'s mysterious disappearances and sickly appearance had me convinced that Draco had become a werewolf, which made me feel pretty stupid when the truth was revealed. I love that she\\'s still able to trick me after five books of getting used to her writing style. Two other things I liked about Half Blood Prince specifically: I love this whole Horcrux thing. It\\'s so satisfying to finally know how Voldemort can be defeated. As a reader I\\'ve been a little more satisfied about the ultimate mystery of the series, how to kill Voldemort, but at the same time I have to read the seventh book to find out if Harry is actually able to defeat him with this information. Harry Potter finally gets a girlfriend! Ginny is way cooler than Cho, and it\\'s good to see \"The Chosen One\" hooking up with someone as talented and clearly on his side. I was starting to feel like Rowling was forgetting about raging teenage hormones, so it was also nice to focus more on Ron and Hermione\\'s seemingly never-ending dance around getting romantically involved. Plus \"snogging\" is among the coolest British slang ever. I approve of the many excuses to use it in this book. Two things I was less than excited about in Half Blood Prince: Harry breaking up with Ginny at the end of the book. She\\'s tough; she can take it. Besides she\\'s already a target as Ron\\'s little sister, which we\\'ve already seen. Besides, they weren\\'t exactly hiding their relationship, even if took Harry forever to get around to snogging her. Someone such as Draco Malfoy could easily inform Voldemort of Ginny\\'s even dearer place in Harry\\'s heart, even if they have broken up. Harry isn\\'t returning to Hogwarts?!? Because of the way these books have been structured and the importance of Hogwarts for Voldemort makes it clear that Hogwarts will still figure in the seventh book. But Harry isn\\'t planning to be a student anymore? I\\'m just having trouble getting my head around this concept. As for Snape killing Dumbledore: \"I\\'m not touching that with a 20-foot pole.\" Since I\\'m so behind the times and I know everyone else has talked this book to death, I feel so unmotivated to get into it in detail on this. Being part of an uber-popular series also makes this book hard to review, so sorry for the lesser quality of this review. My full review is here on my personal website. I\\'ll post a few excerpts here, though: 5.0 out of 5.0 stars The very worst thing about this book is how Dumbledore died. I love that Draco couldn\\'t kill him, but for it to have been Snape was just heart-wrenching to me. The very best thing about this book is Draco Malfoy! ;-) What can I say, I\\'m a sucker for blond bad boys. He wasn\\'t able to kill Dumbledore and I don\\'t think it because he was scared. That whole scene, actually, was pretty intense for me. And Snape... Poor Severus, having to kill his only real friend. *cry* To review the book now is pretty pointless but I\\'m doing it regardless. Everyone knows what a phenomenal series Harry Potter is. This book was beyond expectations. For those who still have doubts about reading the series or continuing it: just do it. I\\'m surprised to find that Dumbledore dies. It was another great book. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was my favorite book in the series! 5/5 stars! Thanks to my beloved co-workers... they spoiled Dumbledore\\'s death for me! but it was still super sad! I read this one when it came out but didn\\'t remember any of it really. Except the big huge thing that happened in the book. Even if it\\'s fiction, it\\'s like dementors are surrounding me or something...like I\\'ll never feel happiness again. Rowling has amazing talent to evoke readers to be so immersed in the story to cry (like I did during the 5th book) and feel as if you\\'ll never be happy again (like with this one). I also feel like this book was a \"in-between\" book. It doesn\\'t feel like a whole book. There was no meeting with Voldemort at the end of the book and fighting him like the rest of the books. Most of the book was spent with many plots and questions and that all ended pretty swiftly in the last few chapters. That\\'s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Oh, JK... I think the Harry Potter series had escaped from your vision of it and was too big for you to control. The first time I got to Half-Blood Prince, my interest had waned quite a bit, so returning to it this summer I could only recall the broad strokes -- Slughorn, and Dumbledore\\'s betrayal, and the people behind it, and the fact that we learned a lot about Tom Riddle\\'s backstory. Thus, I went into it with a mostly open mind, though I mistrust a lot of Rowling\\'s attitude towards her own world. - I really liked how all the layers of corruption in the Ministry were revealed, and while it\\'s horrifying that the entire governmental system of this world is a giant miscarriage of justice, it did add depth to the story. But as with Order of the Phoenix, a lot of the narrative arcs and \"facts about magic\" implicitly support those prejudices. There\\'s a very condescending attitude towards people and creatures with different levels or kinds of magic, even from the \"good guys\" who are pro-Muggle.  once you know that Draco was ordered to kill Dumbledore  you can see his fingerprints all over the more sinister elements of the book and you can see how honestly terrified he is of the darkness he\\'s enacting, even as he keeps coming up with other plans. - I always love learning about Tom Riddle\\'s backstory, and that\\'s really what this book was about, and most of the drama and romance in the present day was filler to support this infodumping. Finding out where he went after Hogwarts and who he killed and why was really really cool! - But then Harry and Dumbledore talked about Merope Gaunt is just awful! I\\'m not defending her use of the love potion to coerce Tom Sr. to marry her, and I certainly don\\'t agree with them that he \"abandoned\" her once he was released from her magic. No, no, I\\'m talking about the conversation that goes: Merope refused to raise her wand even save her own life. \"She wouldn\\'t even stay alive for her son? She had a choice, didn\\'t she, not like my mother--\" ...She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother\\'s courage Excuse me, but she\\'s not the first witch to die in the world?? It\\'s not like it was a selfish plot to become homeless and die in childbirth just so she wouldn\\'t have to deal with a baby?? Ugh!, moving on... - I love the idea that the prophecy only had the impact it did because Voldemort believed so deeply in it that he acted on it, and then Harry responded in kind. I do not love the idea that all of the above worked because Harry is so ~pure of heart~ that he would want bloody vicious revenge even if he hadn\\'t heard the prophecy. First of all, logic fail. Second, in the literal next chapter he almost kills Draco Malfoy in the bathroom, lol, guess he was too purehearted not to. - Actually, most of the ideas about how ~love magic~ and wizarding bonds work, are both inconsistent and pretty disgusting. On a related note, Harry\\'s \"monster in his chest\" re: Ginny, is terrible writing.  I\\'m a little annoyed that three MAJOR plot points happen on the same night, namely 1. umbledore locates the cave with the locket Horcrux, 2. alfoy fixes the Vanishing Cabinet, 3. relawney reveals that Snape was the spy who passed on half of the prophecy . I understand why she does this from a storytelling perspective, because it forces Harry to choose which one of those revelations to pursue, but as they\\'re only tangentially related, it seems like lazy writing. I will end with some genuinely good things from the book - Anything that comes out of McGonagall\\'s mouth - \"There\\'s no need to call me sir, Professor\" - Aragog\\'s funeral I\\'ve always counted this book as one of my least favorites of the series (if not my least favorite), so I was surprised to find that I really, really enjoyed rereading it this time! There\\'s not an awful lot going on for most of the book...the memories and backstory of Voldemort are obviously the most important thing here. Harry\\'s obsession with Draco gets a little old, and there\\'s the whole Lavender and Won-Won catastrophe. But I really love the memory sections, and the Felix Felicis scenes are among my favorites in the series. And the end is done really well, from the cave to the very end, which always makes me cry. I love love love Harry Potter! This is tied for my favorite book (with DH). The ending is wonderful. It\\'s kind of a series closing as we knew it, you know, as peaceful and defeating voldemort at his opening task to conquer all. (Chamber of secrets, stone, etc.) This is the beginning of the end, when they start their horcrux hunt, and everything will be put to the test. I can see how you wouldn\\'t like this if you don\\'t love Harry Potter, but I absolutely LOVE harry potter, so this was just another outstanding novel by Rowling. This book was the first Harry Potter book that I read. Not because I didn\\'t like the movies before, but I never really understood why everyone liked to read back then. So when I started reading the half blood prince, I was pretty amazed with how I was thrown into the book, and how much I loved they way she wrote it. The Halfblood prince, is one of the best books I\\'ve ever read, it had everything a great book should have. I kept trying to guess who the halfblood prince was, and it was nice to get to know Voldemorts childhood. I also loved how much quidditch there was in this book. So of course I give this book the ultimate 5 stars. Rating: 3.5 out of 5 In my opinion, the weakest book of the series. Oh, it\\'s brilliantly written but also heartbreaking, that\\'s the right word. Though, I have a feeling that Harry will return to Hogwarts (or so I hope). I\\'m still kinda upset, though. SNAPE???? WHAT THE FRIGGIN\\' HECK. I mean it\\'s weird that he would be someone\\'s favorite, but I thought it was all play and pretense when he promised to be loyal to He-Who-Has-No-Nose Hmm, how to put my feelings into words. Since so many people have read the books, I tried to stay away from reading reviews on Goodreads, and I did (at least for this book). herefore... I didn\\'t believe Dumbledore actually died until my friend who was also listening to the book with me admitted that he really was truly dead (she\\'s already read the books once). \\'m so confused whether Snape is a good guy or a bad guy. umbledore was so sure he was good, I want to believe that Snape had a good reason for killing Dumbledore.  didn\\'t cry when Dumbledore died (partly because I didn\\'t think he was actually dead and partly because I felt kind of \"meh\" about Dumbledore all along) but I did tear up a little when the phoenix sang his lament.  love that Harry and Ginny got together afterall. nd Ron and Hermione... sigh, the tension between them and their actions/reactions because they like each other but don\\'t want to admit it makes me want to shake them! ostly just Ron though. ah, Lavender Brown... :P Notes: listened to the audiobook, some swearing, kissing, some deaths/torture/injuries One of the least entertaining but most profound Harry Potters. This is the book where it all begins to come together. While the first 4, maybe even 5 books felt as if they were stand alone this and the 7th bring everything together and make it one overarching story instead of several stand alone book. JK has probably one of the most incredible mind out our generation. Snape and Narcissi make an unbreakable vow that he will protect Draco and assist them on his \"mission\" which we don\\'t find out until the end what exactly that is. For a change of pace Dumbledore picks up Harry to take to the Burrow and in classic Dumbledore well meaning manipulation he uses Harry to persuade Slughorn, a former teacher of Tom Riddle, Harry\\'s parents and company to return to Hogwarts and teach potions (Snape has finally been moved to Defense Against the Dark Arts or Dada, if you will.) Hermione is at the Burrow already and the next day they receive their O.W.L results and a school supply list. At Diagone ally they see Draco entering a Dark Arts supplier, Borgin and Burkes and follow him under the invisibility cloak. Harry becomes sure Droco is a Death Eater. Harry was not going to take potions because he did not receive an outstanding, which he needed to carry on under Snape. However when he returns to school he discovers Snapes promotion and Slughorn will be teaching potions. e has to grab a second hand book that he discovers once belonged to the Half Blood Prince  we later learn that the Half Blood Prince was Snapes Mother, snape used the book and recorded all kinds of interesting and helpful spells and potions. or the first time revealing Snape\\'s true brilliance in magic Harry uses the half blood Prince\\'s notes in the potion book which help him to excel in potions making Hermione mad and Slughorn dote on him. Meanwhile Dumbledore is regularly meeting with harry to look into the pensive to see all of the memories of people who have had direct contact with Voldemort. here is one memory from Slughorn that has been tampered and Dumbledore asks Harry to retrieve the real memory, which he does after several false starts  his memory shows us explaining what Horcrux are to Riddle and riddles deep interest in them. umbledore explains to Harry in order for Voldemort to be killed all the Horcrux (where voldemort split his soul) must be destroyed. wo Horcrux (Riddles Diary and Marvel\\'s ring have already been destroyed. . Harry through this learns about Voldemort\\'s family and his path towards murder and obsession with gaining eternal life. Blah blah teenage relationship drama happens. Near the end of the year Harry and Dumbledore journey to a cave to retrieve a suspected horcrux, Slytherin\\'s locket. The locket is at the bottom of a basin and can only be reached by drinking the potion above it. Dumbledore with Harry\\'s help drink and and Dumbledore becomes very thirsty. When Harry get\\'s him water from the lake Voldemort\\'s Inferi surface and try to kill them. Dumbledore fights them off despite being weakened. hen they return to Hogwarts they find the Dark Mark has been placed over the astronomy tower. umbledore tells Harry to get snape, they hear a noise and Dumbledore freezes Harry under the invisibility cloak just as Draco disarms Dumbledore and threatens to kill him. hat follows is a vaguely amusing conversation between the two where redemption becomes evident and possible. eath Eaters that Draco helped get in arrive and encourage Draco to kill Dumbledore. nape comes in, Dumbledore pleads with him and Snape kills Dumbledore. ollowing is another minor battle. arry finds out the locket is not a real horcrux, it contains a note from someone named R.A.B and Harry announces he will spend next year not a Hogwarts but hunting down Voldemort. I LOVE the theme of redemption here. Draco while a snobby little brat still has goodness in him. I love Dumbledore\\'s responses to Draco\\'s arrogance. Harry starts to grow up and we are left with more questions than answers. THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!! Oooooh!!! Honestly I ended up watching all the movies before reading the books (ashamed :( ) but because if that I have been absolutly dying to read the Half Blood Prince. It\\'s my favorite HP movie, ergo my favorite book! I\\'m a bit of an odd one I guess, liking the 6th book over the 7th, but I can\\'t help it :) Draco\\'s in this book more. It seems to be about him and his struggles as well as Harry. I love that because it shows that he has things going on as well and that... I think it\\'s hard for him even being the little rich Slytherin. In the earlier books he was just a little--Draco I\\'m sorry D:-- shit. Ruder and meaner than in thr movies. If y\\'all haven\\'t figure it out by now.... I love Draco/Tom. He\\'s my favoriteist character&actor! J.K.Rowling is just fabulous, if you haven\\'t read the Harry Potter books... SHAME ON YOU! Go do it now! This is the one book in the series that I always think I like the least, only to reread it and discover that I love it just as much as the others. I also always find it remarkable how these three teenagers are immediately prepared to take on just immense responsibility. How Ron and Hermione just so readily agree to drop everything and go with Harry. I think throughout the series we see snippets of Ron and Hermione\\'s strength, Hermione specifically, but this is the point we realize that in their own ways they\\'re just as strong as Harry. One thing that did always bother me with this book is how anticlimactic the cavern scene always seemed to be.  suppose that could be explained due to Dumbledore\\'s death and the fighting at Hogwarts during his death, as well as the fact the \"Horcrux\" is actually a fake, but I\\'ve always just wanted a little more from that scene. ven the fighting sort of seemed anticlimactic as it is told second hand to the reader, but ah well. I do think this book and the final chapter is but a taste of the sadness that is to come in the final original series. Series as a whole: 4-5 stars. I read this when it first came out 8 years ago, but luckily for me, I forgot 99% of what happened so it was almost like reading it for the first time. nd the only reason I remembered who killed Dumbledore was because Sideshow Bob mentioned it in an episode of The Simpsons. I\\'m not worried, Harry, I\\'m with you. Hands down, the best line in the whole series. This might be one of my favorite in the septology. More into Voldemort\\'s past which is exciting and terrifying at the same time. Also leading more towards the end of the series and has great suspense. So, going into my re-read of Half-Blood Prince, I actually expected this to get bumped up to 5 stars. It\\'s not. It\\'s staying 4. For whatever reason, more than any other book in the series, I built this one up in my head as having been way better than I remembered it being. I thought the reveal of who the Prince was had more impact than it actually did, but really...it had about as much impact as in the movie. I will stand by the fact that the book version of Half-Blood Prince is much more fleshed out than the movie version, and in that sense is much better. I had forgotten just how hell-bent Harry is on finding Malfoy out and proving he\\'s up to something. What is interested about this book compared to others is the fact that he\\'s actually completely right. Or, mostly completely. And yet, everyone thinks he just hates Malfoy and is going a little overboard. More than any other book in the series, Harry is sort of right on with what he believes is going on, but even his closest friends just don\\'t believe him. They\\'ll indulge him by listening, but clearly aren\\'t buying into Harry\\'s theories. Anyway...I\\'ll get away from that for a bit. One of the bright points of this book, for me, was Harry and Ginny coming together. I forgot that part of the storyline (probably because it was pretty much absent from the book), and how they came together. It was sweet, and a nice respite for both Harry and the reader in the midst of very bad things clearly brewing in the world around them. I\\'m not going to say I hated re-reading this one, but I will say it was one of the bigger disappointments of the re-read for me. In my mind, I recollected more...happening?....than actually did. I think part of this is knowing the crucial role Snape plays in this book, and also knowing about the reveal in book 7. In my mind, I combined events from books 5 and 7 and thought more of them actually happened in book 6. So, basically, it\\'s all my fault this one was a disappointment. One more book to go! Another great Harry Potter book and it\\'s still going strong after six books in. This book is a little bit darker than the first five books, which I like. The ending is very sad and so good. It made me feel a lot of emotions for just being a book. I would recommend these series of books to anybody. After the previous installments, I remember this book felt a bit underwhelming on my first read--a prologue to the real action in Deathly Hallows. Now, however, I think this is actually an improvement over the previous entry on the series. After the lack of a solvable central mystery in Order of the Phoenix, I\\'m very happy to see that Half-Blood Prince is meticulously plotted again, which three more or less separate mysteries converging throughout the novel: the nature of Malfoy\\'s plans, the mystery of the Half-Blood Prince\\'s spellbook, and the flashbacks into Voldemort\\'s past as we begin to understand the key to his immortality and possible defeat. We also get to spend a lot of time with Dumbledore, which is great, especially on the third chapter, when he arrives at the Dursley\\'s house. I also really liked the character of Horace Slughorn, a somewhat morally grey dude who\\'s still the most decent person I\\'ve seen come out of Slytherin. To be honest, I do still think that from Goblet of Fire onwards all these novels could have done with some trimming. Just cutting out all the repetition meant to make sure the reader can\\'t forget anything would be helpful. Ah this book. I still remember being in COMPLETE DENIAL about Dumbledore\\'s death at the end of this book. I religiously followed dumbledoreisnotdead.com, and I am convinced to this day that J.K. Rowling was planning on having Dumbledore still be alive but when she saw that website said, \"JK (teehee), he\\'s going to really be dead.\" Actually, to be fair, after this reading, and now that I\\'m reading book 7 again, I do think she actually intended on him dying. But my 16-year-old heart just couldn\\'t take the fact that Dumbledore could really be dead. I enjoyed this book, but I feel like it doesn\\'t stand well on its own -- it\\'s all to set up book 7. We learned so much more about Dumbledore in this one, but then he gets taken away in the worst way possible. I loved the Half-Blooded prince on paper and I absolutely cannot believe who it turned out to be since I don\\'t like that character. 2015 Reading Challenge: A Book with Magic. It doesn\\'t matter how many times I read this series, I\\'ll always love it every single time. The book with the greatest potential and the greatest let down. Don\\'t get me wrong, the Harry Potter series (the first four at least) can be enchanting, engaging and a truly worthy read... ... BUT it\\'s not worth the hype. I could name HUNDREDS of books and a score of series that would be a better use of your time than HP but, sadly, did not receive the \"hype\" this series did. Until the last two, somewhat three, books were read, I was somewhat of a Potter nut. I gave the fourth book five stars for a reason, after all. But starting at the fifth book, the story begins to fall off track. The sixth book was downright disappointing, the fact that a FAN GIRL gets the hero annoyed me, the seventh book, had it\\'s moments, I admit but Rowling should be shot for that pathetic epilogue. I\\'ve seen better writing from ten year olds and I am not exaggerating. Over all, I would tell you to try the series out. It\\'s been a great gate-way book into other (more worthy) fantasy books for many, many people and HAS convinced many kids out there that reading can be fun! It\\'s one of the few series out there that I believe will have some historical value because of that fact. If you are looking for an astoundingly great read, however... ... look elsewhere. re-read in 2016. This is a great book. It\\'s amazing to see how she has set up so much in the previous books and brings some of it to light in this book. Author J.K. Rowling returns back to form in the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series. Although the darkness from the later novels is ever present, the magic and charm from the first books in the series returns to bring a nice balance to this novel. Like a lot of people, I\\'m sure, I was out last night at midnight picking up my copy of the eagerly anticipated Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I went to the grocery, anticipating not only no lines, but also that I could purchase other things I needed, and get home faster to begin reading. I\\'ve read each of the Harry Potter novels by J.K. Rowling in less than a day, but today, having finished the sixth installment, the feeling is somehow different. ::: Beyond the Order ::: The blurb on the inside of the book jacket gives the reader a clue that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is going to be somewhat different, focusing on the everyday at the wizarding school Hogwarts rather than events happening outside the school. As the story begins, Professor Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster at Hogwarts and Harry\\'s staunchest protector against the evil wizard Lord Voldemort, comes to fetch Harry at his aunt and uncle\\'s home during the summer holidays. Harry\\'s family, Muggles (non-wizards) all, display their usual fright at being confronted with anyone from the wizarding community. As Dumbledore escorts Harry to the Burrow, home of Harry\\'s best friend Ron\\'s family, for the rest of the summer, he lets Harry know that he will be giving him private lessons over the course of the school year. He also has a task for Harry; luring a new professor to Hogwarts, Professor Slughorn, who the reader assumes will take over the Defense Against the Dark Arts position that somehow ends up vacant every year. Of course, with Rowling, things are never as they initially seem. Dumbledore\\'s private lessons with Harry actually consist of delving into Lord Voldemort\\'s history. Slughorn, who seems to want to cultivate a small cult of students who will move on to bigger things, or have important connections, doesn\\'t actually become the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. And Harry\\'s ongoing battle against Voldemort takes several unexpected turns. ::: The New Harry ::: While Rowling\\'s twists in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince live up to her usual gift of surprise, including the source of the assistance that Harry gets from the Half-Blood Prince of the title, there are too many plot devices, sub-plots, and characters left hanging. Fred and George Weasley, usually so entertaining, appear at the beginning of the book and then get little more than a mention for the rest of the book. An engagement between Bill Weasley and the former Beauxbatons student Fleur Delacour seems almost pointless, and the \"intrigue\" regarding the depressed condition of the Auror Nymphadora Tonks is similarly introduced and then wrapped up a bit too tidily. Even Professor Slughorn seems to have little to do other than one plot point that fits in a bit too neatly with Dumbledore\\'s charge to Harry. Even more noticeable, the irritable teen of Order of the Phoenix has been replaced with an almost unbelievably mature Harry, who seems to have accepted the loss of his godfather much too stoicly for a 16-year-old boy. This is a new Harry, one who is nearly an adult. But it feels at time as if Rowling has lost touch with her character. The listing for the audio book includes Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince as part of the Romance genre, and while you expect that 16-year-olds have some raging hormones, at times, everything else takes a back seat to the \"who is snogging with whom\" game. Probably the biggest surprise to me was how much less dark and violent Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is compared to the previous two books. My five-year-old daughter has fallen in love with Harry Potter, and while I\\'ve let her read the first three books, the violence in Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix are too much, in my opinion, I probably would let her have this one. Rowling\\'s dedication of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is to her baby daughter, and the reader is left to wonder if perhaps her feelings about pregnancy lightened the mood a bit. The series, up until this point, had gotten progressively darker, and yet Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, even with the darkest wizard ever known back in full power, seems almost Pollyanna-ish at times. Still, for Harry Potter fans, it\\'s been a long wait, and at nearly 700 pages, it\\'s still worth the read. While too many plotlines are tied up a bit too neatly, it\\'s at least a bit refreshing to have had so many questions answered that have been left by the previous six books. No Harry Potter fan will be left unaffected by the ending, and once again, Rowling will leave fans clamoring for more, waiting for the last installment, which promises to be very different from the previous six books. This review previously published at Epinions: http://www.epinions.com/review/Book_H... This one might actually be able to challenenge Prisoner of Azkaban for favorite in the series. love love love it. Still remember my sister screaming from teh other room when she got to a certain pivotal part in the book. So well written. To say the truth.. till this day I view this book as a really long Prologue to Deathly Hallows. This is the book that set it all in action. for a whole year and half after it.. it set my head swirling trying to identify the rest of the Horcruxes.. and Identifying them I did =D (I was never as much proud of myself as I was by discerning about the locket B) *yup I\\'m brilliant*.. and Naguini and Harry himself. I couldn\\'t believe what happened to DD. I thought it might be a hoax.. but when I thought more about it.. I realized it isn\\'t. This is the book when Voldemort is at his most horrifying.. We get to know how he came to this life.. a sad story and you can\\'t but pity his mom. We get to know how his life was at the orphanage.. an uneasy child he was and a creepy one.. no wonder how his dislike for muggles who averted him and disliked him back came to be. We get to know how attractive teenager and powerful wizard he was.. and how he wasted it. Voldemort\\'s background doesn\\'t excuse his horrible ways and let us understand why he became the dark lord.. no it emphasizes how it\\'s our minds and our choices that set our course. Like Voldy, Harry\\'s parents were out of the picture even before he can picture them. Like Voldy, Harry lived as an orphan.. but even worse his \"family\" made him feel more orphaned than any orphanage can make a child feel. Like Voldy, Harry was a peculiar child with no friends. But unlike Voldy, Harry decided not to let all this erase his faith in Good and justify why he may act Bad. A better message a writer can send to the world can never be. I AM NOT OKAY. I used to rank these books but the reread has completely ruined any hope of that. How are these books so good???? Neither can live while the other survives. This is the prophecy that haunts Harry throughout his sixth year at Hogwarts. He now knows that he has no choice but to face Voldemort, and to do such he must find his weak spot. With Dumbledore\\'s asistance, Harry ventures into Voldemort\\'s past, and finds the secret to his destruction. The goings-on inside Hogwarts take center stage in this novel, with the students battling their way through classes, Quidditch tryouts, and love. Dramatic battles and Draco\\'s serious dilema lead to breath-taking,screaming, gasp-inducing moments that we cannot forgive Rowling for. Just to warn you, there will be tears. Hilarious in parts yet serious in others, Harry Potter 6 is not a disapointment. Despite the heartbreak, I loved every moment of it. Ah, my initial memories of these one are somewhat tarnished.  desperately waited for the new installment, waiting at the bookstore with friends, and when we finally received our copies, one of them flipped to the back and shrieked Snape kills Dumbledore! and it kind of let it down. I still love this book though, then and now, because we see all that has happened up until this point makes sense.  also desperately defended Snape, much to the disbelief of my friends.  believed there was something in the pleading, and in the argument Hagrid overheard, but it was still with a sinking heart that I read it, and I hoped with all my heart I\\'d be proven right.  sure was! On to the final book in this reread that I do periodically. Harry Potter is as much alive in my every day now as it was when I was waiting for books and movies; I have over 1600 facebook pages updating me with HP news every day after all! Severus ... please ... This book broke my soul into so many pieces, it would put Voldemort to shame. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before. Never before, in all my re-reads of Harry Potter, had I realized how AMAZING Dumbledore was. And not just that, but how much Harry relied on him. Dumbledore was \"The Only One He Ever Feared\", and honestly i can not believe my 13-year-old-self, i was such an idiot for not loving that man. AND DRACO MALFOY\\'S CHARACTER BUILDING Seeing self-confident, narcissistic Draco cry was shocking. And how he didn\\'t kill Dumbledore even when Voldemort threatened his life? BRILLIANT character progress! Book 7 here i come! (Don\\'t break my heart please) Great how JK Rowling explains about all of the misadventures that Harry Potter has. hat I did not expect was the death of Dumbledore. The concept of a magical world drew me into these books and I will stay with Harry Potter until the very end. I gotta say, this book surprised me. The first time I read Harry Potter, the standout books (to me) were the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows. The other books seemed to be more filling, a way to get from one point to the next. My first reread, I fell in love with Order of the Phoenix, and developed a grudging admiration for Prisoner of Azkaban. (By grudging admiration, I mean I rated it five stars instead of 4.5.) And this reread, Half-Blood Prince is the book that wowed me. Everything, from the teenage angst to the character-driven plot to the revelations at the end, seemed perfect to me. Perfectly plotted, perfectly placed. I loved learning about Voldemort, about how his past shaped his future. I think I mentioned this in my Chamber of Secrets review: the parallels between Voldemort and Harry are kind of astounding. It\\'s what they did with the tragedies in their lives that truly made them into who they are. Also, I liked the idea of the prophecy - how it had no power until Voldemort gave it power. That\\'s pretty cool. And I loved Harry\\'s time spent with Dumbledore, though I\\'ll admit Dumbledore\\'s constant secret-keeping and mysteriousness did get a little irksome at times. I understand he was doing it all for Harry\\'s benefit, I really do, but that was possibly my only qualm with this book. I also loved Harry and Ginny . (Margaret, don\\'t do it . don\\'t do it . GINNY WEASLEY IS A WONDERFUL CHARACTER FULL OF FIRE AND LIFE. SHE TOLD ROMILDA VANE THAT HARRY HAD A HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL TATTOO. THEIR FIRST KISS WAS IN FRONT OF AN ADORING CROWD, AFTER GINNY HAD WON THE HOUSE CUP BECAUSE HARRY HAD LANDED HIMSELF IN DETENTION. GINNY IS AWESOME AND AMAZING. How, how, how did she turn into the abysmal shadow of herself that was in the movies? Tying Harry\\'s shoes? Do you trust me? I FEEL PERSONALLY VICTIMIZED BECAUSE OF THE TAMING OF GINNY WEASLEY. Ahem. That is all.) Another aspect of this novel that hit me right in my feels was Draco Malfoy. It is here that his character transcends the petty, \"my father will hear about this,\" nemesis of Harry\\'s that he serves in the earlier books. It is here that Rowling illustrates the way he is treading water in a pool that grows deeper the more he kicks. The boy is in way over his head, and that is the saddest part - he is just a boy. Just sixteen. Already being threatened by Voldemort; already serving his Dark Lord. And it is here that Harry\\'s character matures towards his schoolboy rival. He begins to pity Draco at the end, begins to see that they aren\\'t so different after all. I read this book pretty quickly (as it\\'s 2:30 a.m. while I\\'m typing this review, I\\'m going to say I finished in two days) and, even though it was my third time, was completely absorbed in the reading. As such, I didn\\'t have many English-nerdy, bright analyses, but I did have a few comments. -Whatever happened to the other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers? Voldemort applied for the job, presumably, about 20-30ish years before Harry went to Hogwarts. So did 20-30 teachers all just quit after a year? Did any of them die (before Quirrel)? Forget Marauders - I want a DADA teachers series. Oooooooh, now there\\'s an idea! -Cormac McLaggan. That name. The more you say it/read it, the more grating it becomes. I low key spent the entire novel wanting to punch him in the face. -RON SAYS \"ER-MY-NEE.\" squeal. -Speaking of teenage angst, I kind of wonder whatever happened to Lavender. I despised her within the context of this narrative, of course, getting in the way of my OTP - but I think that she would have been a decent character when not affiliated with Ron. Does she die in the next book? Has J.K. Rowling released information on her future? I honestly can\\'t remember. Man, I hope she doesn\\'t die . -Fred and George are really awesome, and I\\'m so glad Mrs. Weasley can finally see that. I\\'m just refusing to think about what happens in the next novel. Nope. -Slughorn referred to Ron as Rupert. I see you, J.K. Rowling, you sly dog. I see you. And, as always, some of my favorite quotes: \"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly. Yes, sir. There\\'s no need to call me \"sir\" Professor. The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. SASSY HARRY IS MY FAVORITE HARRY Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure. Utter perfection within a single quote. The thing about growing up with Fred and George,\" said Ginny thoughtfully, \"is that you sort of start thinking anything\\'s possible if you\\'ve got enough nerve. LOVE GINNY. LOVE FRED AND GEORGE. LOVE THIS QUOTE. Ooooookay. It is time. MARGARET ALYSE\\'S HARRY POTTER REREAD CRY TALLY! Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone: 1 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: 0 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: 3 (!!!) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: 2 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: 2 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: 6 Yes, you read that correctly. I cried SIX FREAKING TIMES at this book. Possibly because I read it in two days. When Harry smelled the flowery smell from the Burrow in the Amortentia potion. Have I mentioned how much I love Harry and Ginny? The quote, \"It was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.\" This just . touched me on so many levels. And Harry was so dang awkward in response. It was adorable and I\\'m not ashamed to admit that I cried. When Dumbledore\\'s insisting on drinking the potion himself, and Harry is panicking. Maybe it\\'s because I knew what was coming, maybe this is a hidden gem of a scene that is often overlooked . but I felt that this scene really helped to solidify the relationship between Dumbledore and Harry. \"I am not afraid . I am with you.\" So many parallels . such a beautiful moment. Draco\\'s struggles when faced with Dumbledore. He\\'s just a kid, younger than I am (granted, only a year, but all the same). He\\'s so young, and being forced to kill someone - at the possible cost of his family! That is twisted and demented and wrong. Harry\\'s grief and shock. This dude has lost so much. So many people. And every time, he\\'s had to pick up, go on . he\\'s such a strong character, it\\'s frankly astounding. (Though it is interesting: Harry\\'s never been to a funeral before Dumbledore\\'s? Wow. I\\'ve been to seven, spoken at one. I\\'m not sure why this surprised me, but it did.) TOTAL CRY TALLY, AS OF HALF-BLOOD PRINCE: 14 Now, onto Deathly Hallows, which will probably rip my heart into little tiny shreds. Probably? Pretty much definitely. I don\\'t know how to rate this entry in the series. What did everyone else think of it? And why? re-read in prep for book 7 (7/29/07) Okay this was not bad butttttttt Harry is a very stereotypical boy when it comes to Ginny and I\\'m disappointed. More re-reading, and I\\'m almost full up with HPness. On the other hand, I think this is my new favorite of the last 3 books - more depth, the whole Harry-is-right-Malfoy-is-Up-to-Something plot, and more pieces I didn\\'t quite remember from previous readings. The entire funeral scene is stuck so hard and so visually in my head, I am always startled that all the things that happen in the book don\\'t happen in the movie. Half-Blood Prince is the best HP book, fight me. I did y\\'all a favor and rewrote page 596. Re-read: September 2015 The first 300 pages were slow and boring. Too much recap - get on with it. But the end was awesome, with a good Empire Strikes Back-esque cliff-hanger. There needed to be a scene of Harry and girlfriend Ginny interacting before they fell in love, but hey, it worked. My prediction after reading: In the next book, Harry will discover that the horocrux locket was taken by Regulus Black, left in 12 Grimmald Place, then taken by Mundungus and sold. Oh, and Bellatrix has another horocrux. ** spoiler alert ** I forgot how much I love this book. From sassy Harry to the dark themes. I love how final Harry\\'s childhood feels by the end of this book. He realizes now more than ever that he has to go on this important mission no matter what. I cannot wait to start the final book. Read July 2012 Re-read July 25-Aug 8 2013. This one is probably my favorite in the series, because the character become more than just cardboard cutouts; especially Dumbledore! Ron is as annoying and useless as ever. The part where Dumbledore... you know. Still as effecting as the first time I read it, my heart pounding, hoping for a miracle. Just re-reading it with the understanding of the hatred and revulsion on Snape\\'s face as he does it, it\\'s so moving. I don\\'t understand why people like Malfoy so much. Ok, yeah, he didn\\'t have the desire or the guts to kill Dumbledore, but if it weren\\'t for extraordinary good luck, he would have killed two other people. And he and his parents don\\'t necessarily like the consequences of being evil and befriending a soulless murderer; well gee, cry me a river. I don\\'t like the Malfoys, and I am annoyed that people find them so awesome when they ARE NOT. THEY ARE JERKS. Re-read Aug 2014 Reread this, this time with my 10 year old as he read it for the first time. I was struck with Rowlings ability to show things a bit at a time or not at all. From this book, you would not expect anything that happens in the 7th. That is amazing to me. There\\'s just so much MORE to the story and you think you will know how it goes and you don\\'t at all. There are some very subtle things through the first books and #5 that you can only notice after you\\'ve read #7, it\\'s a lot of fun to see that. I do love this book. Re-read Aug 2015. I told Josh I would buy him a butterscotch beer if he re-read the Harry Potter series with me over the summer break. He\\'s beat me to the finish, as he\\'s done with #7 as I\\'m finishing this one. It\\'s a great read, as usual, but I can\\'t understand why Dumbledore didn\\'t tell Harry he was dying and he asked Snape to kill him. Surely he realized what might happen when they came back to Hogwarts; even if not in that moment, sometime in the near future Dumbledore knew what Snape would do. Why, why didn\\'t he tell Harry. It\\'s completely irrelevant to the tasks Harry was given. It seems like he only didn\\'t tell him because PLOT, but it doesn\\'t do anything for the plot. It struck me as very annoying. Re-read Jul 08, 2017 Fun re-read, still sad. How can you possibly make a book about magic so boring? This should have been called Massive Plot Dumps with Dumbledore instead. This is probably my favorite ...... oh wait. That\\'s so hard to decide. I love this book though. This one and number 3 are my favorites to reread, probably because of all the teenage romance and because up until the climax, the pacing is a little more relaxed. I love the end of this one. She makes some daring moves that are always a pleasure to read. I bawled like a baby in the last pages. This was the most emotionally touching book of the series. I am not a huge Dumbledore fan but his death marks the end of an era! Also Snape - poor, poor Snape! Malfoys find out that anyone can be victims of the dark side, irrespective of blood status. Not feeling so good about it now, are you? Dear (sexist jerk) Ron, Ginny is not your property. Nor is Hermione. Both can do whatever they like in their lives. So please stop acting like an entitled prick. Is that clear? Yes? Thank you. Dear Tonks, get over it already! There are many fish in the sea. Well, that\\'s all. I just wish I hadn\\'t given the other books 5 stars because this definitely merits a higher rating. Second to least favorite of the 7, but still so good and that ENDING. I refuse to write reviews for these books because there is just too much epic awesomeness for me to do it justification. Just read it, damnit. The salve to the wound that is book 5 and by far my favorite. I am not a sci-fi person and so surprised by how invested I had become with these books. Year 6, 16-years-old, brings the drama and romance that I usually look for in a book. LOVE IT! Whoa, ok. No snark, all impressions. My impressions: -Called it again. But this time more :( -Cho was a ho, and so is Ginny? Wait--what? Where did this come from? -Horcruxes are reminding me of when Link has to collect the pendents to get the master sword and then you get taken to the dark world to get the seven crystals and it gets a lot less fun from there in Link to the Past. Will the next book be less fun? Probably. -Never trust a book that has handwritten instructions. Shoulda learned from that diary. -Why was Malfoy allowed back at Hogwarts at all this year? -She\\'s really gotten bored with Quidditch at this point, huh? -And the food and candy -I want a Pensieve. -Snape IS A BUNGHOLE. I was wrong to doubt my original assessment. Or was I? I have a feeling his story is far from over. A missing piece. Haven\\'t worked it out mentally. Well, one more to go. She shed the over detail long craze of books four and five, and got more to the point with this one. I expect more of the same for the last installment. Here I go... Again, I have been spellbound by Rowling\\'s writing style. I love how she follows the great writing traditions of other English greats. If you love fantasy and being enrapt in another world, then you will love this series. With Rowling\\'s wicked sense of humor and vivid narrative, Hogwarts and its occupants come alive and I found myself unable to put it down and thinking about it after I had. I just love getting lost in a story and Rowling makes it easy. I cried long after I finished this book. It was even more moving and captivating than the last one. This is definitely my favourite book in the series so far! Put three stars because only at the end the book started to have something action and for 80% of the book it was just dragging along with the usual. I think it was the slowest read from all potters for me. The ending of this one made me so freaking mad! *Ugggh* Just one of many rereads and yet I still pick up on new bits and pieces I missed or glossed over before. And book Ginny is the best. Those last chapters still hurt... all these years later and they still hurt... Once again, the dark side of this series is in full force here. But even with the terrifying stories of how Voldemort came to be and all the terrible things he did, there are the bits of teenage angst and relationship drama one would expect from sixteen year olds. This is also the first time there is something set up for the following book. At the end of the others its just assumed that school will resume as normal, and whatever happens will happen. This time around they aren\\'t going back to school, there is a wedding to attend, Harry has a vague plan for defeating Voldemort, and they need to find R.A.B. (The setup is rather nice!) At the end of the book, when Fleur announces that Bills scars will prove that he is brave and that she is beautiful enough for the both of them, and when Tonks begs Lupin to understand that she loves him regardless, and when Ginny says she never gave up on Harry and that she still won\\'t, it proves everything that Dumbledore has always said is true. Love overpowers Evil. I have reviewed the series as a whole,  here. I\\'m desperately trying to remember what happened in this book, but nothing really jumps out at me. So about average for the series. 4 STARS \"It is the middle of the summer, but there is an unseasonal mist pressing against the windowpanes. Harry Potter is waiting nervously in his bedroom at the Dursleys\\' house in Privet Drive for a visit from Professor Dumbledore himself. One of the last times he saw the Headmaster was in a fierce one-to-one duel with Lord Voldemort, and Harry can\\'t quite believe that Professor Dumbledore will actually appear at the Dursleys\\' of all places. Why is the Professor coming to visit him now? What is it that cannot wait until Harry returns to Hogwarts in a few weeks\\' time? Harry\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts has already got off to an unusual start, as the worlds of Muggle and magic start to intertwine...\" (From Amazon) The novels are all coming together and the suspense has me hooked to see how it all ends. I feel like my heart and soul have been ripped from my body. So many tears, and \"No, no no no no no!\" this book will rip your heart out. I loved it, it\\'s very well written, the characters well done, the story well told. It\\'s Harry freaking Potter. Just leave me to my tears now...as I prepare to get ready for the final book in the series. *sobs* And why can\\'t we have half stars? I\\'d put it at a 4.5 but, close enough! Few minor issues with the book but still thoroughly loved it! For the first time ever, I have loved Ginny. It was written just as well as the others, but I didn\\'t like it quite as much because, it being the 6th book out of 7, it started to reveal and solve the mystery/suspense rather than increase it...This, of course, is appropriate, but I just found it not quite as exciting - and also sad! (The series is drawing to a close!) Yoooo all the feels are back man. I forgot how addictive this series is. I can finally say that, Ron, Hermione and Harry are #SQUADGOALS Book Ginny is my new crush! This is my favorite HP book, because of how seamlessly Jo combined the worlds of magic, war, and teenagers. It is also the first book to ever make me cry. This will forever be my favorite Harry Potter book. Loved re-reading this book. he second time around I didn\\'t cry when Dumbledore died , but I did get really emotional when Mrs. Weasley was talking about Bill and how young men who are healthy don\\'t always stay that way. Serious heart string tugging was going on. I liked that Voldemort is a total sociopath and collects trophies, like in TV shows about serial killers. It made me imagine him having a map with lines going everywhere and pictures of Harry Potter all over his bedroom. I didn\\'t find Slughorn as annoying as I originally found him this second read through. Still obnoxious but also really smart and calculating. Can\\'t wait to read the last book but I don\\'t want HP book club to end! I was wrong. The Half-Blooded Prince is even darker than its predecessor. Everyone is finally growing up. Falling in love seems to be one of the characters purposes in this book. There\\'s a couple of love triangles in this one. Namely, Ron/Lavender/Hermione and Harry/Ginny/Dean. Jealousy is at strike for them and their love for each other is inevitable. Harry is in love with Ginny Weasley, Ron\\'s sister. Hermione loves Ron, even though he is with Lavender Brown, his snogging partner(Ha! Meanwhile, Dumbledore has a plan for Harry: Revisit Tom Riddle\\'s(Voldemort) memories. There they find Riddle\\'s darkest intentions, his childhood, and the reason why he became the man that he is now. That causes a new discovery: Horcruxes, which are pieces of soul in inanimate objects to ensure the person\\'s immortality(that\\'s what I understood, anyway). Voldemort has seven Horcruxes and they have to be destroyed. Also, Harry finds a book with the name tag: \"Half-blooded Prince\"(hence the title). The book helps Harry to pass Potions and develops an obsession with the book. Talking about obsession, Draco Malfoy is up to something, and Harry wants to figure out what is it. I\\'ll say it: He is Voldemort\\'s helper. Someone seems to regret it. This book has a lot of twists, unfortunately, it has been spoiled repeatedly. So much, that I don\\'t think it matters if I say it: Snape kills Dumbledore. There. I said it. End of review of the almost final book. I read somewhere that the last books of the Potter series lagged in comparison to the rest... That was a lie. If anything, I\\'m enjoying this series more and more. ut  WHY DID YOU KILL DUMBLEDORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  CRIED so HARD! o, no no no no... first Black now Dumbledore! hose next  Hagrid? .K. owling - did you invent this series just to break your fans\\' hearts? arry Potter without Dumbledore is like a night without the moon... you have the stars, but they\\'re just not enough.  cries ) So yes, I\\'m officially hooked. I\\'ve joined the bandwagon. Count me in. Some books instantly remind me of winter, this is one of them; but it is much more than the fact that I started reading this one next to a wood burning stove, covered in blankets. This book is cold. There is a tinge of bitterness and melancholy since the beginning, really; you can feel it while reading, some parts even make you feel sad. What happened at the end of Order of the Phoenix brought with it a promise of global change and it\\'s almost palpable now. There is no safe place anymore, Harry can trust very few people and even some of those he trusted to be friends still refuse to believe what he says about Voldemort, even though there could not be clearer evidence of his return. Nonetheless, I absolutely enjoyed this book from start to finish; I love how Rowling changed the whole pattern of the books from \"summer time; Hogwarts; problems; adventures\" to a real quest to defeat Voldemort. Differently from previous books, on this one nothing of particular impact happens to Harry before the new semester at Hogwarts begins. The only significant event that I can recall is Dumbledore using him as a human magnet to attract a new, supposedly, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. So we are introduced to Slughorn, which I liked from minute one. In my opinion, he is one of the most believable characters that Rowling ever created. Most of the wizards (not considering Harry, his friends and the majority of the Weasleys) display a certain stoic behavior; some of them, like professor McGonagall, for instance, don\\'t even express much emotion during the entire series. Slughorn, on the other hand, is a Russian roulette of conflicting emotions since his introduction. He feels proud of most of his acquaintances, ashamed of some, afraid of others. He feels attracted to the opportunity of being a teacher which would allow him to meet even more talented people, but afraid of what impact the exposure as a teacher would make in his life now that the world of wizards is being set upside down. Well, after this events, Harry is sent to the Weasleys\\', where nothing really meaningful happens. Then we have the customary travel to Hogwarts, where some enmities are reinforced, we might say. I must say that the atmosphere at school is utterly different from any of the other books. Some students didn\\'t even return to school, so afraid they were, which I don\\'t quite remember happening before, even when the Chamber of Secrets had been reopened on book two. As soon as the semester starts, Dumbledore starts inviting Harry to private conversations at his office, so we start to realize what this book is really about: send normal school affairs to the dumps, let\\'s investigate Voldemort\\'s past so we might come up with some way to defeat him. I found it great how Rowling added rebellious teenager behavior to back up Harry not caring much about school anymore, focusing on his new found mission. It added a much more believable sense to the character and to the whole story itself. Anyway, during the whole book we get to know, through collected memories of people who interacted with Voldemort during some points of his existence, a lot of unimaginable and priceless information which helps us understand what drove him to become what he is now: a monster. Setting Harry\\'s mission apart for an instant, I would like to mention how fun some parts of this book were, due to the tinge of \"sex, drugs, and rock\\'n\\'roll\" that Rowling displayed. There are constant love conflicts, hormones are exploding everywhere; even Hermione, which I could never guess cared much about people, was found crying in the corners, feeling alone and betrayed. Again, giving young wizards a little bit of \"muggle\" adolescence hell was very well done in the sense that it makes the story much more believable. As the story goes on, Dumbledore and Harry get closer and closer to uncovering Voldemort\\'s deepest secret, which leads them to go outside Hogwarts in search of evidence. Unfortunately, the results of their little adventure are disastrous. Getting advantage over Dumbledore\\'s momentary absence from Hogwarts, the dark forces find their way into the castle and things get really bad. Rowling is not afraid anymore, so the signs of her advanced \"George R. R. Martin syndrome\" are firmly displayed, which makes me take a star out of this book. The ending is bitter and sad, setting a clear path to what we can expect on the final book. Interesting quotes that I didn\\'t include in the review: It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right. Re-Read Number thirty-something - July 13th 2014. My second favorite of the Potter books, I\\'ve read this one about a dozen times. It\\'s always nice to curl up with a favorite book, even if the Malfoy plot one drives me nuts. Definitely one of the darkest of the books, this was truly a heartbreaker, I adored finding out more about the Malfoy\\'s and their involvement with Voldemort and Snape! oh Snape! awesommmmmenesssssss of awesommmmeneeeees Old friend Dumbledore why have you left meeee??? My favorite book from the series, mostly because it makes a little bit clearer who is going to end up with Hermione, and I was betting on the right one, so I think I was happy I got it right the whole time. And so lies the book that set forth a thousand adults\\' tears. So great is its prominence that when I emerged for dinner, very subdued, my family joined me in mourning after I told them I\\'d just finished The Half-Blood Prince. God, Jo. Why don\\'t you don\\'t you snap a broomstick across your knee and stab me in the heart with it? I\\'m sure it\\'ll be much less painful. Re-read June 2014. Oh my gosh!!! I can\\'t get enough. Must. have. seventh. book. NOW! (Full review to come.) This book broke my heart!! Dumbledore died.. wtf CAUTION: SPOILERS I actually can\\'t believe I\\'m on the last book already. I was always intimidated by the size of this series (and the size of the books in it), but it has flown by! So fast in fact that I don\\'t want it to end. I am in awe at how much this series has gotten under my skin! I\\'ve tried to read other things in between, instead of just binge reading, but I\\'ve found that I have trouble getting into anything else because all I can think about is continuing the series. And I know I\\'m going to have a book hangover from this series! It\\'s definitely special, and it\\'s going to be hard to read something that compares after this! I have to say I was kind of underwhelmed with the reveal of Snape being the Prince. I mean, it made sense after Hermione explained it, but there wasn\\'t really a big revelation there. It was just kind of like, Oh, I\\'m the Half Blood Prince...and then was barely mentioned again even though the book is named after him and the Prince\\'s book was a major part of the whole story. Also DUMBLEDORE OMG. I had trouble believing it at first, which is ridiculous - I remember his death very clearly in the movie, so I *knew* he was dead but even still, it didn\\'t seem real! I still can\\'t get over it. I did eventually start crying when they were all talking about it, and again at his funeral. I CANNOT DEAL. *sobs* FINALLY, Harry and Ginny get together! I didn\\'t realize how late in the series it happened. I kept waiting for it! Also, I kinda wanted to bash Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s heads together. They clearly have the hots for each other! Something I absolutely love about this series is that there is never a love triangle between Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Harry and Hermione are never more than just best friends. It\\'s so rare to see platonic love in stories, and I wish there was more of it! Boys and girls CAN just be friends, people. I love that Harry and Hermione prove it. And it\\'s absolutely beautiful! They are as close as brother and sister and I love it so much! I think their friendship is one of my favorites in fiction. I want a platonic friendship as deep as they have. Favorite quotes And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure. This review was originally posted on Novel Heartbeat. To see a breakdown of my assessment, please visit the full review here. Whether adult or child! What a great fun read! 1st read: 2005 2nd read: 2007 3rd read: 2014 Yes yes yes I\\'ve only just now finished this... GET OFF MY BACK lol I don\\'t know why it took me so long. I have mental problems. But OMG I think this is my new favorite Harry Potter book! I loved learning everything about Voldemort\\'s background and I just thought this one was so so good. I mean they are all amazing. Again, I don\\'t know my problem... Anyway I listened to the audiobook for this one because Jim Dale is a freaking amaaaazing narrator. It was so much fun listening to this. I love love loved it. These books are just so magical and I\\'m so glad I finally experienced this one. Also... the movie now seems so shitty in comparison lol. They changed too much and I just... I mean I thought I really liked that movie, but now I just think about how much it failed. *SPOILER ALERT* in case I\\'m not the only weirdo who hasn\\'t finished this series. but my biggest problem was that in the movie, Dumbledor didn\\'t \"petrificus totalus\" Harry... in the movie he was just hanging out underneath them... and that\\'s so NOT Harry! Harry would never just stand there and not intervene. They should have had Dumbledor petrify him. That makes so much more sense! And he still could have gone after Snape that way because the second Dumbledor died the curse was broken! So.... I just don\\'t understand why they changed that in the movie?! It\\'s so out of character!!! Also I\\'m mad they changed Harry and Ginny\\'s first kiss and get together stuff. It was not as good in the movie at all. They just changed silly things that I don\\'t get. Although... I will admit that I loved the portion of the movie when Harry had taken the felix felices. That was so funny! Lol I enjoyed that part of the movie a lot. So I didn\\'t mind the changes they made there I guess. But still. The book was SO much better. Of course. Because it always is lol. Thankfully, this book was much better than its predecessor and was probably the best in the series so far. It was nice to be at Hogwarts but not constantly covering the same ground as in previous books. The pace was steady and it moved along well. I\\'m looking forward to the next one. We were not prepared for this book. This book is the darkest so far of the series. Harry begins secret lessons with Dumbledore in order to find a way to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Highlights include awkward teen romance, The Slug-Club, and a very suspicious Draco Malfoy. Best moment has to be: \"There\\'s no need to call me \"sir\", Professor\". Highly recommend. My goodness, this is a great book. The depth of character development is amazing. Although the book is substantially long, it doesn\\'t feel so; it reads quickly. By the end of this book I am always feeling as if I\\'ve been on a roller coaster ride and I\\'m always in tears. Rowling amazes me with her ability to choose the exact right word for every situation. Her writing is exemplary. This last reading was probably around the tenth time I\\'ve read this and it gets better every time. My favorite book of the series (we\\'ll see if Deathly Hallows can top it). Enjoyed every second! I don\\'t know if I have cried so much reading a book. I have one more book but don\\'t know if I want to read it yet because I really like being in this world and don\\'t want it to end. That was the saddest ending among the books so far. Even though I knew what was going to happen from having watched the movies, the book has ten-times the impact of that certain wizard\\'s death. It was devastating, really. The Half-blood Prince has absolutely knocked off The Goblet of Fire from my top favorite Harry Potter book because it was certainly the most brilliant of them all. And that\\'s really something since every one of them were magnificent. The romances. Gosh, Harry and Ginny were so adorable! I couldn\\'t keep the goofy grin off my face. The kiss after Gryffindor won the House Cup! Ron and Hermoine. Tonks and Lupin. Even Bill and Fleur. Fleur ceratinly won me over as she had Mrs. Weasley with that \"I\\'m good-looking enough for both of us\" bit. But of course, the most important part of the book, Harry learning of Voldemort\\'s past. The Horcruxes. And how deep the bond Dumbledore and Harry had developed throughout the series. How Dumbledore saw Harry as an equal and how much he trusted Harry. The \"I\\'m not worried. I am with you.\" was quite moving. Draco Malfoy. Hmm. I still want to believe there\\'s still hope for this boy. I still don\\'t like him but he\\'s as much as a victim here than anything else. Snape, on the other hand, I never liked him really. BUT I know he\\'s really not a villain. I think he\\'s working on Dumbledore\\'s side as much as Harry was... because I\\'ve seen the movie. But I dunno, The Half-Blood Prince was the last movie I\\'ve seen yet. That makes me excited on reading the last book (LAST?! Whaaa?) because I have no clue at all what was going to happen. Norwegian audiobook. So I did like this one more than the previous, but I still felt there were quite a few holes. My first problem with this book is Dumbledore. Am I the only one who didn\\'t like him? I actually did like him in the movies, but in the books he is more annoying. I feel like he is just absent in the movies so it\\'s hard to dislike him, but in the books he is actively avoiding people and being secretive about it. I feel like all the books thus far have ended with him saying something to the effect of \"I have underestimated you Harry and it has lead you to grave dangers. I must not make that mistake again, from now on I must be upfront with you and trust that you are strong enough to deal with the truth.\" And then the next book he runs around being secretive again. This book is no exception. He even starts giving Harry lessons to make it seem like he is sharing information, though in the end it takes him almost the entire school year to tell him one thing. Also, why is it so necessary for Harry to get this memory from the other professor if Dumbledore already know what Voldemort had done and has already started destroying the horcruxes? The memory actually doesn\\'t confirm anything at all. Another thing, if Dumbledore knew what Malfoys was doing the whole year why didn\\'t he do something earlier? Why does he wait until the actual confrontation to say \"we can protect you and your family\". Wouldn\\'t it have been more likely to help him if the intervention was earlier, when he was less involved with the death eaters? Seems like he never really had any concern for Malfoy, which I don\\'t disagree with, but don\\'t come around and the last second and pretend you cared all along. And then lastly, a point about his beginning scene. I think the beginning when Dumbledore goes to Harry\\'s house is supposed to be funny, but really it was just rude. It reminded me a lot of that article where they explain rape as if you are offering someone tea. You can\\'t force your tea on people. It is perfectly fine to not drink the tea, even if it is offered to you. It\\'s also fine to offer tea. But if people don\\'t want to drink it, it is not okay to pour it down their throats. Anyway, onwards. I thought this book was pretty good. I thought that this book was much like the previous where there was not so much action, but this one did work on the development of the characters more. I think that overall all the characters got a bit more depth to them. Ginny, possibly the most. Snape, for the worse. The story had a few parts that were a little unclear. The cave being the largest one. It\\'s a bit unclear why and how Dumbledore is able to guess how exactly everything is supposed to be accomplished. He says that magic leaves traces, but I\\'m not sure how that leads him to the realization that drinking it is the only way. Another part is the entire thing surrounding Snape. All of the questions Beatrix asks him in the beginning are super valid questions which he does not offer good answers to. Also, with all these ways of getting into people minds and watching their memories and truth serums, why can neither Voldemort nor Dumbledore utilize these with Snape? I can see the good side having some reservations about using such tactics, but I feel like Voldemort would not. And what about the unbreakable oath thing? Why would Voldemort not have every death eater doing that? Also, why was Dumbledore so secretive about why Snape switched sides. Why did everyone just have to trust Snape on his word? Voldemort\\'s wrath seems much more deadly and even his people openly questioned that decision. Overall, an okay story to read but as the series continues the plot holes are stretched larger. I still remember the day my bff spoiled the ending of this book for me in class. He wasn\\'t my bff for about a month. No matter how many times I read this year in particular, it always makes me cry. It is SO suspenseful that it keeps me on the edge of my seat. Finally Harry gets over the angst of his 5th year, and the annoyance fades from our relationship. I adore this book, the plot thickens, the characters develop, and Rowling writes beautifully as ever. Still a great book, even the third or fourth time through. This remains my favorite for so many reasons. For one, it\\'s very much a calm-before-the-storm sort of book. There is so much rich backstory given that add layers to our villain. And Dumbledore, my God, I enjoy seeing so much of him here. He is deeply wise and emotionally intelligent, a kind mentor and merciful enemy. I love how apparent it is that the secondary and even very minor characters have rich, complex lives outside of what is going on with Harry. Remus and Tonks give me the feels every time. And Ginny is clearly a brash, passionate force who never gets quite enough page time for my liking. I also found on this read through, a special appreciation of Molly Weasley, Super Mom. This is my favorite book in the series. It contains mystery, tragedy and sacrifice...it pulled on my emotions much more than any other book in the series (which I still love anyway). SPOILER WARNING (seriously, you should have read these books by now, but just in case, don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.) Aaargh this book. I want to love it so much, such a step up from OOTP but man that friggin ending. I hate it and I love it, but the bad vibes kind of overrule. I loved Dumbledore\\'s funeral, a very nice farewell to such a great character but I hate how he died. But most of all I hate that stupid \"noble\" break up Harry does with Ginny. Seriously? We\\'ve been waiting for those two to get together since forever, you give us a measly couple of chapters near the end of the book with hardly anything of it happening on page and then you just end it. And for what? This stupid shit about \"I have to let you go to protect you\". Bull-shit! Are you seriously telling me that someone like Lord Voldemort won\\'t be able to figure out how much Ginny means to him because he breaks it off with her for no reason whatsoever at the funeral? Oh and Ron and Hermione can come along on his grand adventure but who cares what happens to them, right? It is just poor writing which sticks out like a sore thumb in a series that is otherwise for the most part so well written and I can\\'t deal with this right now because I\\'m grieving for Dumbledore, damn it! I\\'ve become more lenient over the years and upped it from three stars to four, but you cannot expect to do stuff like that and get full marks. Not going to happen. Rowling did a lot of things right with this series, the romance however, isn\\'t one of them. Why is this in the \"Chick-lit\" list??????? I just loved it. That\\'s all I can say. It\\'s easy to understand and the characters... just wow. I\\'ve read this book like five times but: still sobbing. I am re-reading the Harry Potter books as part of a group exercise some friends and I are doing. We each chose a book from the series and will go through and write in the margins sharing thoughts, etc. throughout. I chose HBP because it\\'s my favorite book in the series. This is the book that took the series in a completely different direction. It introduced the idea of Horcruxes, made Snape one of the most debated characters in history and rocketed along with lots of humor, fun and a touch of romance as well. Perfection. Re-reading it reminded me why I love the book so much and I fell back into love with all of the characters. The descriptions are great, the humor spot-on and the characterization are what make the HP series shine as well as Rowlings incredible world building. HBP is everything you could want in an HP book and definitely over-delivers. Love it! First time i read The Half-Blood Prince: Nooooooooooooo, DUMBLEEEDOOOOREEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! (Die Snape, you mother*****) Third time I read it: Nooooooooooooo, DUMBLEEEDOOOOREEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! (Snape, I\\'m still not over it..) Finished reading this with Angie today. I will forever treasure the memory of Angie bolting upright as if she was going to the rescue of one of the characters during one of our reading sessions. I can\\'t wait to see what she thinks after the last book. Well, like I remembered, this book sure is about the inevitable march toward doom. Rowling can still make lots of apparently disparate details suddenly come together in some excellent plot, and I\\'m a huge sucker for all the Tom Riddle backstory. And I noticed lots more details this time through. But reading the end bits at bedtime was pretty miserable-making. Aaaand, now I\\'m ready for HP7. I think. I re-read this because Three Cups of Tea was making me cry too much. What was I thinking, this makes me cry too. Dammit. My significant other read this one before me, so we were discussing parts of the book as I read it. During the course of these discussions, we have renamed the book, \"Harry Potter and the Year that Nothing Much Happens...until the END!\" Don\\'t get me wrong, this latest installment in the Harry Potter series is still a well written and engaging novel. It\\'s just that the story does not move along with the same energy as most of the earlier novels. The characters are still well developed and the history that we are presented with in this volume is very interesting as well. I just feel that I could have done with a lot less snogging and lot more actual events. I\\'m not going to ruin any of the twists in this book by going into too much detail, but suffice it to say that I did feel that this was a decent book, it just left me feeling a bit cheated and wanting for a bit more out of it. Oh well, not everything can be a home-run! yayyy. It only took me a week to read this book-it was short enough to carry around in my purse, so it got read about a billion times faster than the last couple. The \"emotional work\" that it does is great--suck it, Lavender Brown. The flashback structure is pretty decent. The Draco dilemma is about as good as it could be. The thrilling finale kind of comes as a surprise--and of all the books, this is the one that knowing the plot arc sort of ruined for me--I kept wondering when/if things were going to happen. Finally: For the record, I liked when Tonks was like \"Lupin! I love you!\" and Mr. Weasley was like \"Young and whole men don\\'t always stay young and whole forever.\" Sniffle. This was my favorite of the series... until I read the Deathly Hallows. I knew it was coming. I knew perfectly well and was prepared. But... it still stung... and it hurt a lot. BRB STILL CRYING Not as good as the last few books, but hey, nobody\\'s perfect. I think the issue here is that Rowling had to make sure she set up everything she needed for the grand finale in Book 7, and that threw the flow off for this book as a stand alone work. So I will reserve final judgment until after I read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. picked this up again as a comfort-read. trying to resist rereading the last book before the movie comes out because i know it\\'ll just make me annoyed with the movie. I would mark this as definitely the weakest of the Harry Potter books: Harry is much less likeable, his friends are at each others\\' throats the whole time; I was disappointed. It ends with a very smashing climax that makes it worthwhile, but I didn\\'t like most of the rest of it. J.K. Rowling does a lot of things well: high-school romance is not one of them, in my opinion, so this book where that is the focus just didn\\'t do much for me. ** spoiler alert ** I don\\'t really know what I think of the beginning, since the first two (clearly important) scenes are done outside Harry\\'s frame of reference. The whole point of the books has been that we\\'re in limited 3rd person POV - we find things out when Harry does. That\\'s been the clearly established rule for 5 books, I don\\'t understand why we\\'re changing it in the 6th. Obviously the point of being an author is that you make the rules, but once you\\'ve made your own rules you\\'re supposed to abide by them until you\\'ve also created an exception. That can be done more easily with substantive rules - you can have vampires wander around in direct sunlight eating garlic for all I care, if you say why you\\'re doing it. But a style rule that\\'s been clearly established isn\\'t supposed to be broken, unless you need information that CAN\\'T be conveyed any other way, and I don\\'t see why she couldn\\'t have conveyed the information in those scenes later in the book in the usual way. Okay, yes, it\\'s clearly important that we know about the Unbreakable Vow, but Harry found out about it anyway, so I\\'m not sure why we had to know about it when we did. The point could have been to introduce Narcissa and use Bellatrix again, but I\\'m not sure why we care. Or I guess it could have been that we suspect Snape, which would definitely be fun and games, but I\\'m suspicious of that clearly planted suspicion. My best guess is that we need to know not only THAT Snape made the Unbreakable Vow, but WHAT he vowed to do, and that must have been the most convenient way to do it. Also, I would like to veto love triangles. I know, I know - we have a bunch of 16 year olds of the two genders in constant close quarters, it would be more shocking if we DIDN\\'T have triangles. But it\\'s woeful to have to read it for a million billion pages. And Ron really can be a spectacular McAsshat when he wants to. (Lavender? Really? I have nothing against her, but really?) Although I worry about where she\\'s going with Ron and Hermione - they FIGHT. A LOT. And I don\\'t think that would change that much, no matter what happens...it hasn\\'t been the \"bickering of unspoken passion\" all this time. I think Ron started the snarking of move around Year 4, but Hermione has been thoroughly...Hermione until this year. Also, I kind of like her with Viktor Krum, because it was FUNNY. Although I am surprisingly myself by being a supporter of Harry-Ginny. I heart Ginny and I think she would work well with him. I mean, if it goes bad it will go VERY VERY BAD, as Harry himself as pointed out, but maybe it won\\'t go bad. Maybe there will be ONE THING in this ENTIRE SERIES that doesn\\'t end up going bad. ....Or she could be the one who dies at the end of book 7 WAH VETO. One disadvantage of being a Johnny (jill?) come lately is that I knew that Dumbledore died, just like I knew that Sirius died, but I managed to block that out with the supreme conviction of someone who believes that the bad ending will have worked itself out by the time she gets there. Unfortunately, it did not, and I am deprived of Dumbledore as I was deprived of Sirius, and yea verily I cried. I cried harder for Sirius than for Dumbledore, though I\\'m not sure why - probably because why Dumbledore\\'s death wasn\\'t a shock, how it happened was, and I was too busy screaming \"WHAT THE F!\" at the book to really be emotionally wracked. I had to go back and read it twice just to make sure I really understood what had just happened, because it seemed like there was just no way. So the end.....W. T. EEEEEEFFFFFFFF. I mean, what WAS that? Was it an Imperious Curse? Was it the consequences of the Unbreakable Vow? Or have Ron and Harry been right all this time? And it\\'s so utterly bizarre because earlier in the book I\\'d been thinking about how even though Snape doesn\\'t always like it, in the end he does usually seem to do what\\'s right, like when he made Lupin the serum or when he tried to teach Harry Occlumency-whatever, even though he doesn\\'t like it, and that was what had me convinced that Dumbledore was right in trusting him. And I\\'d thought that maybe if Harry just sucked it up and apologized to Snape and actually tried being polite it might help - like if he\\'d had sorry for his accidental disemboweling of Malfoy. I mean, yes, Malfoy was trying to use the Cruciatus on him, but I\\'d been thinking if Harry just manned up and said to Snape, \"Professor, I\\'m sorry I did that,\" without making excuses, that might make a different. But then after all of that it turns out that HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS HOWARD CHRIST ON A POGO STICK SNAPE BETRAYED THE POTTERS???? and I seriously rethought that idea. And then...and then after ALL of that, has he really been still working for Voldemort this ENTIRE TIME? I mean, I\\'d wondered if everyone circling you for all those years going Dumbledore trusts you but we don\\'t and we just want to make that VERY VERY CLEAR could eventually crack you, and then--wha--wha--what? And Dumbledore DIED FOR A FAKE HORCRUX AND WHO THE FUDGE IS R.A.B.? My brain has just waved a tiny white flag and crawled into the corner to cry. Dear J.K. Rowling: please cease and desist phunking with my heart. Book 6: The prologue to Book 7 Unfortunately, this book did not stand up when read directly after Book 5. Where the Order of the Phoenix dove deeply into scene descriptions, superfluous dialogue, and Harry\\'s interiority, this book steps so far back from Harry\\'s feelings that it could be a story from any character\\'s perspective. The plot, while still being better and more cohesive than some other published novels, was very simple for a Harry Potter book. I would equate the Half-Blood Prince with the complexity of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, only a little more boring because of an utter lack of new and interesting ideas (really, mentioning inferi a million times does not significantly increase the worldbuilding...). This book is the Sorcerer\\'s Stone for older readers. I\\'m looking forward to reading the next book, where stuff actually happens again. ** spoiler alert ** D totally got what he deserved. well written, but i don\\'t like any of the characters. Reread For the full review, please visit Thoughts and Pens Finally, the second to the last installment of the boy wizard\\'s amazing story. I\\'ve read this book ages ago but I can\\'t stop re-reading it especially these fast few months. I am terribly missing Harry and the gang. You must probably know by now (if you\\'ve read my past HP book reviews) that I intend to finish reviewing all the Harry Potter series because I owe him big time. Anyway, this is the second to the last HP that I\\'m going to review and I\\'m definitely moving read another series. (Watch out for that one) To start with, the Half-Blood Prince currently holds the number 4 spot of my favorite Harry Potter sequels with Prisoner of Azkaban holding the top spot. I have mixed emotions about it, not in a negative way though. I don\\'t know whether I\\'d be happy with it or be heartbroken when JK finished one of my favorite characters. That\\'s a spoiler, I know, but it\\'s necessary to be able to convey my review for this book. Going into the specifics, there are a lot of things I like about HBP. Number one is that JK Rowling didn\\'t fail to give us another jaw-dropping twist and mystery in this book that by the end, I was breathless like a trout out of water. Second, it answered some of the questions that have been hanging in books 3, 4 and 5 but leaving a slight cliffhanger at the end...just enough to make everyone happy and thrilled to read the last book. Third, the oozing teenage romance of our young heroes made my heart flutter and my stomach queasy with anticipation. And I totally admire that JK portrayed it in a funny, wholesome way unlike some other books out there that takes advantage of the whole romantic angle in an attempt to save the book. Fourth, I love how JK Rowling chose HBP for tracing Tom Riddle\\'s life history. It was very well timed and did not feel like the whole Riddle\\'s story was inserted to make the pages longer. Fifth, JK Rowling\\'s consistency with the characters, their interactions, and dialogues have always been a reason to look forward in reading and re-reading the books. There was never a time that I didn\\'t smile every time a sarcastic remark or a punch line is delivered. And to emphasize this, I love the new character introduced in this book, Professor Slughorn. He\\'s an outrageous, overenthusiastic glutton that dots on Harry every opportunity that he got. Maybe an older version of Colin Creevey? Sixth, I just love everything about HBP: the more serious tone, Harry\\'s obsession with what Draco\\'s up to, Slughorn, Harry\\'s unashamed credit taking for his new potion brilliance (at least he\\'s being authentic. Ha! ), Ron\\'s newly found hobby (snogging in public), Harry\\'s moment of finally finding the right girl (spoiler), the lessons with Dumbledore, and Riddle\\'s life being dissected. But there\\'s one thing that made me mad about this book. WHY? WHY does Jo need to be sadistic in taking something that we all learned to love? Isn\\'t it enough that we are completely in pain for Harry\\'s past? Isn\\'t Harry\\'s past losses painful enough to feel the need to strike him with another blow? *sighs and cries* To wrap this review, HBP is an excellent spectacle to set the stage for the final book. It tidied up the loose ends from the previous books without spoiling your hunger for the next book. A must-read even for the most reluctant HP readers out there. Favorite quote: \"And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\" I really enjoyed this book in the series. It\\'s at the top with Prisoner of Azkaban. I especially loved all the background information on Voldemort that the movies skipped over. A really fast read and highly enjoyable! This series is so sporadic with quality it astounds me. There is no real middle ground; I either love, or I hate the book, and I can say for Half-Blood Prince, it\\'s the former. This book is amazing. It has suspense, and romance, and humor, and heart-break, and even with everything going on I wasn\\'t bored! There wasn\\'t a moment where I was waving my hand and huffing because two [or more] characters were taking a billion years to figure out the obvious, nor were there spots where I was growling at the characters for being idiots. Also, without spoiling anything, I\\'m gonna hint real quick here...You all should know by now how much I love love-stories that have been budding and growing for YEARS (years, people, YEARS!). And we see that here... And this makes me very happy. All in all I REALLY enjoyed this installment in the series, and I\\'m very much hoping the next one (the final book) won\\'t disappoint.. I like to end on a bang. The best book in the series! Amazing! So first off the confession: I am relatively sure this was my first read through. I remember the night this book came out. I went to the midnight event with a friend even though I didn\\'t have a book reserved. I remember when she came bursting into our room into the whee hours of the morning sobbing that Dumbledore was dead (honestly if you don\\'t know it yet it\\'s not my problem). I\\'m relatively sure I watched the movie. Okay so yes I am still fighting off the last of the sniffles. I have not watched or read anything about the seventh year I\\'ve only heard things. Things like that Snape was good all along and the crazy fan girls were vindicated. I looked at Ben at one point tonight and said I will never like Snape. He is like the brutal soldier in movies who hates everything and enjoys the fighting. He might be fighting for the good guys but the hatred still boils inside you. If Rowling manages to when me over in number 7, well she has already earned her fame. Oh I do have another confession! Even though I knew the story of this book I totally forgot that the Half-Blood Prince was Snape! I can\\'t imagine the next book honestly and so I will cut this short and go disappear. (This is the sixth book of the Harry Potter series.) I\\'ve been spoiled a lot about this series but not about what happens at the end of this one. Which means it all took me by surprise and I cried like a baby. And then I talked to my boyfriend about it and started crying like a baby again. I need a break before I read the final book. Also, Harry/Dumbledore in this is what makes it for me. Review from previous reading, Dec 31 2008: This book gets sticky for me at a few places. When Harry\\'s kind of too busy stalking Draco to think about anything else he really got on my nerves. Bleh. But other than that it\\'s actually one of the most engaging of the series...which is saying something. I love the parts with Dumbledore in them. Even moreso than in any of the other books - Dumbledore is hilarious. He\\'s truly at his best when faced with death. I also like how he get short with Harry in this one, finally acts more like you\\'d expect him to and less...patient all the time. Seriously, anyone who reads this and immediately goes into The Deathly Hallows? I don\\'t see how you can dislike Dumbledore. After a long break....maybe. But I just love the characterization. It brought a lump to my throat every time someone mentioned Sirius, too, so it wasn\\'t just Harry. Reviews will be after this month due to conflicting schedules Note: Already read two years ago, but because I just remembered to check, so there it goes. The only thing I didn\\'t like about this book was Dumbledore\\'s death. Yes, I am finally breaking down. Read in two days (possibly even one day- not sure) after being acquired from the Ariel\\'s (former bookseller in New Paltz) release party. A lovely reread. First time since watching and rewatching the movie. Two things were better in the movie. The rest is better in the book. Although the movie does make a nice condensed version. I wish they had shown Dumbledore\\'s funeral. The dialogue between Harry and Dumbledore during the drinking of the potion in the cave is much better in the book. Dunno why it was all \"Please\" in the movie. I thought those people knew dialogue. Anyway, there is a lot of reveal at the end that could perhaps have been shown at other points. All in all, a good story. Wonderful characters. Ms. Rowling is very inventive. Too much. Just too much. One of the best books I\\'ve ever read. It was revealing how much more first person it is than the movies, which is one treat of written stories, and I understand a bit better just how single-minded Harry can be. Rowling\\'s characterisations are amazing and there\\'s just so many characters to revel in while following the adventure of Half-Blood Prince. Especially loved the budding romance of Harry and Ginny, and hers is a magnificent character, too. If you\\'ve only seen the movie, like I had for a long time, I suggest sitting down for a few nights with this charming, modern classic work of fantasy. Here, Harry\\'s almost lost everything he\\'s ever loved. Still grieving for Sirius he remains mostly the same. I like that here Harry mostly doesn\\'t have to deal with most of the problems that he shouldn\\'t be having on his shoulder his age. He has a more sense of normalcy than in the other books where he\\'s depended upon. Harry Potter will always be my favorite book series. Half Blood Prince I especially loved b/c Snape is my favorite character from the books and I loved learning bits from his past. I read through this book so fast just to get it out of the way so I could finish the series, to be honest. This was my least favourite installment. Again, when I read it I was too young to appreciate the conversations telling historical stories about the history of certain characters. Even looking back on the series though, this wasn\\'t my favourite. If it were possible to skip over it and understand the final book, I would have. Probably my second favorite of the series. I love the development of Ginny Weasley into such a central character. Part of me wishes for a spin-off of her last year at Hogwarts. Reader thoughts: And it gets darker. There are quite a few things I don\\'t like about this book, and it\\'s not because the book is poorly written. It\\'s just because so many bad things happen to our characters. The plotting is still good. riter thoughts:Dumbledore had to die, of course. he mentor character can\\'t stay throughout the entire hero\\'s journey. arry can\\'t become his own hero if Dumbledore is always there for him.  suppose Dumbledore could have been incapacitated another way, but then the next book would have been about saving Dumbledore rather than stopping Voldemort. aybe Voldemort could have kidnapped Dumbledore and kept him in a coma or in stasis in some way? aybe to gloat over? ind of like a Han Solo carbonite freezing. t\\'s happier, but that has other problems. It\\'s amazing how long I can take to read a book half this size, but an HP book I can blow through in a matter of hours. I swear, the first two times I read this book, I didn\\'t like it very much. Third time, a couple of the scenes between Harry and Dumbledore choked me up. This time, I thoroughly embarrassed myself systematically losing my shit every few chapters. I still have a lot of problems with this book, sometimes Harry is a little too snotty to be palatable and the plot gets weak in points, but Harry Potter books have an inherent, insatiable charm that always hits me right in the feels. I feel like my soul just got trampled on. I haven\\'t cried this much since Augustus Waters happened. If it weren\\'t for the romance subplots, which I still hate (sorry Jo), this might be my favorite book of the series. I love the backstory on Tom Riddle, and learning about the horcruxes. That\\'s pretty much all I have to say :P I don\\'t know if I\\'m emotionally prepared to read Deathly Hallows now. Aaah. Harry Potter is Amazing and J.K. Rowling can do no wrong! ** spoiler alert ** I tend to think of this volume as an interesting, almost quirky point in the Harry Potter series. It continues the dark tone set by Order of the Phoenix, punctuated by near-deaths, macabre happenings, and the brutal loss of a beloved character. It also effectively serves as the first part of the series conclusion, with the pivotal, much foreshadowed war between the forces of good and evil well underway. However, unlike the books directly before and after, much of Half-Blood Prince hearkens back to the first books by focusing largely on the daily happenings at school. Rowling continues to have much of the action that impacts the story\\'s climax happen in the drawing room. While some take issue with this, I have found it to be an interesting and effective way of ensuring that the story is told primarily from Harry\\'s point of view, so that his surprises are also the reader\\'s surprises. This is handled in a better fashion than in my favorite volume, Goblet of Fire; while the end of that book made the behind-the-scenes action more noticeable, Half-Blood Prince unfolds more gradually, with periodic acknowledgments of the other side\\'s shadowy actions and a conclusive final gambit. This book also echoes the exposition-heavy feeling of Order of the Phoenix. As less kind reviewers have pointed out, a large portion of this book is dedicated to Dumbledore showing Harry bits and pieces of Voldemort\\'s past. On its first reading and as a standalone book, this makes for a somewhat slow and meandering plot, but I feel that it makes sense in context of the entire series. The fourth book introduced the grim direction of the story\\'s second half, the fifth book gave insight into the good guys, and this one gives insight into the bad guy; now the reader is ready for the conclusion. I very much enjoyed the peeks into Voldemort\\'s backstory, as they helped make more sense of the character (rather than dismissing him as being evil for evil\\'s sake). Also of note is the reflection of Harry\\'s predicament from the previous book; whereas before he was determined he knew what to do and was proven unfortunately incorrect, this time his instinct is correct from the beginning, and nobody will listen to him. Both instances prove to have dire consequences (the least of which is Harry\\'s irritating teenaged sulking and yelling, which I have to admit is authentic from a character standpoint, even if it bugs the hell out of me). The most refreshing part of Half-Blood Prince, however, is the return to the charm and levity of Hogwarts itself, even with the sinister undercurrent. Most of the action in the book takes place in or between classes once again, and the serious business of the main story is broken up by Quidditch, classwork, and young romance. This feels like a final acknowledgement of the relatively benign setting introduced in the first Harry Potter books, and it instills the same mixture of nostalgia and wonder that those books did. Furthermore, it makes the events of the book\\'s main story more jarring and emotional, as they occur over and around both the light-hearted magic and everyday teenaged conundrums of Hogwarts, and culminate in a direct assault on both within the school itself. Of course, any discussion of this book would be incomplete without covering.... ...SPOILER.... ...the death of Dumbledore. This falls neatly within the confines of the version of the monomyth that Rowling has heretofore created; with Dumbledore gone, Harry loses his mentor and last confidant, and is therefore as prepared as he\\'s going to get to venture forth and defeat the villain, which is what he immediately sets out to do in the last chapter. While Dumbledore is given Rowling\\'s usual abrupt death scene, he is also given a touching remembrance through character reactions and an elaborate funeral, which serves as the setting for Harry\\'s next decisions. The impact of his death is immediately and profoundly felt by both characters and readers, especially considering how much time was spent during the book endearing the reader to Dumbledore. Always a whimsical and comforting character, even with his aura of power and authority, Half-Blood Prince establishes his benevolence to the point of laying it on a little thick. Nevertheless, his death leaves a palpable feeling of uncertainty as Harry prepares to face Voldemort and kill or be killed, setting just the right epic tone for the end of this book and the beginning of the final volume. I found that I liked this book much more the second time I read it, just like Order of the Phoenix. The characters are fully realized by this point, and react to situations in more realistic ways. Half-Blood Prince strikes an interesting balance between the fantastic and the macabre, and while not perfect from a story standpoint, it does a fine job of maintaining the overall story arc\\'s rhythm. This book also connects loose ends and throwaway moments from previous books into brilliant character and story setpieces, revealing Rowling\\'s penchant for grand designs and planning ahead. Further, if you are an unapologetic Harry Potter fan like me, Half-Blood Prince serves as an examination of some of the series\\' most interesting characters (Severus Snape first and foremost among them). On to reread the finale! ** spoiler alert ** I\\'ve always felt that this is the book where shit gets real. This keeps with Rowling\\'s habit of upping the ante the older her characters (and her readers growing up with the characters) get. It\\'s fantastically well written and enjoyable. I don\\'t remember if we get full details in \\'The Deathly Hallows\\' on Snape\\'s betrayal, but I\\'m going to be pissed if there\\'s not. I had to revisit this one after watching the movie for the first time. Was the movie based on this book? Ah, that damn old fool. I have to give it up to Harry for having great instincts and for fighting for what he believes in and for his best friends for putting up with that hero complexion of his (I mean where he wants to take the world all on his own). Got to prepare for the waterworks in the next book. Rereading this book was wonderful. It\\'s still tied for my favourite with book 3 despite the end. It\\'s the last book that takes place with some normality, and I like that. Yet Harry and his friends are older and the stakes are higher than they have been thus far. There\\'s also a great mystery winding its way through the storyline, and that keeps it interesting the entire time! I really need to go to Harry Potter World in Orlando... I can\\'t. OW DARE YOUUUUUU KILLL DUMBLEDOREEEEEE HE CANNOT DIEEEEEEEEEEE AEFAOPIHDF;ASDHA;LDJN;SAND;ALSND HE\\'S THE MOST POWERFUL GOOD WIZARD GODDEMITTTTTTTTQRNAO;HRAOJSDAJSD h my God I can\\'t believe Rowling killed Dumbledore.  can\\'t believe this. hat\\'s the most absurd thing ever. o wonder there\\'s so much of Dumbledore in this book.  thought it was weird having him around more than ever. heir meetups also show how patient Dumbledore is and how a good wizard he is. nd then you kill him!!  am so mad at Severus Snape I can\\'t. e was pleading to him. umbledore was pleading to him \"Please..Severus..\" and you AvadaKadavra him!! ow dare you!! ow dare you!!! e need to find Snape and kill him now please. ow! rgh I\\'m so mad at him I can\\'t. hen I read it, I refused to believe it.  thought Dumbledore had some trick up his sleeve like maybe clone himself or anything but when it finally hit me, I can\\'t. is character shouldn\\'t have died. ut what Harry said in the end is right, he is now all alone without any adult or parent figure to stand between him and Voldemort. his is how it should be. e have to face him alone. nitially, I thought this book is kinda a fallback after The Order of Pheonix but the ending takes it all.  mean the book was kinda...not slow..but focuses on mundane things too much even for Harry. hat\\'s with his suspicion towards Malfoy that seems childish sometimes, the love stories between them, the half-blood prince book, the private lesson with Dumbledore, etc. ut like I said, the ending takes it all. tw, I really like how Harry got together with Ginny. t\\'s like sort of happen but in the right way and they should totally not break up at the ending though I think they will get together again soon in the final book. h no it\\'s the final book already!!  can\\'t do this! \\'m not ready to leave this world. O!!! -------Edit after almost 12 hours------------  am still so mad at Snape right now.  can\\'t believe Dumbledore died just like that. t the hand of the person he trusted nonetheless! uch treason! nape should not ever be forgiven no matter how remorseful he is after this. ut even so, Dumbledore died still believing in good in people. e still trust Snape even to the last straw. f you must know, I haven\\'t watch the movie before this.  think I only watched the first few and the final one. nd I never really pay attention to the spoiler cos I always try to avoid one as much as I can so Dumbledore\\'s death came as a real shock to me. \\'m just few years late lol. nd the movie, Oh my God, it is so dull! t doesn\\'t do any justice to the book! he book is so full with feelings all the time but the movie lack of those. ntil the end of the book, Harry is still full with anger and fury but in the movie, Harry goes like \"Wow I can\\'t believe how beautiful it is from here\" like =.=! nd there was no Dumbledore\\'s funeral!! nd Ginny made the first move in the movie!  really like how Harry kiss Ginny first out of the heat of the moment. h well. Still good. Listening to audio books at double speed can get you through a tome like this much faster. I liked this one a lot. It\\'s great to finally know the background of He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named. I\\'m furious with Dumbledore for trusting Snape. Why was he so retarded?? It wasn\\'t hard to tell he was still working for Voldemort ever since the first book. I\\'m still hoping that Harry gets with Hot Hermione. I don\\'t care what you think of me, this book is damn good. ** spoiler alert ** After I was horribly disappointed with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I took a year to read book 6. Book 6 was back to form, Harry wasn\\'t a moody, whiny teenager and the plot was fast and engaging. I really enjoyed the back story of Voldemort. I\\'m a little disappointed that Snape and Malfoy behaved exactly as they had been set up to behave all series. I had hoped they might have a redeeming moment, and they may yet, but it\\'s kind of like reading a murder mystery only to find out the red herring really did do it. ******Spoilers****** Why is it that I can\\'t believe when characters die in this series?? I\\'m still not convinced that Sirius is gone. I guess I believe Dumbledore really did die, but it lacks the emotional punch that it should have had. I think it\\'s because they\\'re wizards and they should be able to wave their wands or mutter a curse and save themselves. Anyway, I can\\'t wait to get my hands on book 7 and see how it all ends. Too bad it\\'s got to wait until after I can read Mockingjay!! Vote: 4,75 Class: L-A2 (FP) (second to last of the Harry Potter saga) Great, just great! I\\'m at loss of words to describe these unbelievable amazing books. I\\'m re-reading the series ten years after the last reading and I\\'m finding it just as wonderful, and I can\\'t wait to begin move forward to the final one. I adore the characters, the beautiful writing style, the story with all its twists. And this is not, definitely, a children book but it\\'s simply put a great book. Like I said before I can\\'t point out what is the best thing about this series but I really think this is one of the best book I\\'ve ever read. Certainly worth re-reading and recommending. One of my all-time best book. know that Snape had a reason for everything he did, and we find this out in the 7th book, but his betrayal hits me hard every time. owever, it makes me very happy that he does not allow Draco to kill Dumbledore. This entire book is dark. I feel like it is the darkest of all the books. I remember reading it for the first time and not grasping all of it because of that. However, as I got older and read it again (and also once the movie came out and helped), I understood some of the subject matter better and I enjoyed the story better. In this lead up to the grand finale in the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling ratchets up the tension in another strong installment. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince deviates a little from the \"formula\" beginnings and endings that we\\'ve come to expect from the series. Rowling also keeps readers guessing about Snape\\'s true loyalty. hile...Dumbledore\\'s death along with Harry\\'s decision not to return to Hogwarts but instead pursue Voldemort both raise the stakes considerably. . Bottom line: J.K. Rowling continues to deliver: new characters, intricate web of subplots, and continued development of the core characters with a few surprises along the way. ** spoiler alert ** I enjoyed the 6th entry of the series much more than book 5. I particularly like that Rowling gives the readers a taste of Lord Voldemort\\'s backstory. I found it fascinating to see how he went from an angry orphan with a penchant for stealing from and hurting others to a sinister adult with a hidden agenda. This book easily serves as a bridge between Harry\\'s timeline and how Tom Riddle became Voldemort. My only issue with the story is that even though Snape suspects Harry of having the half-blood prince\\'s potion book, he never pursues and/or proves it because Harry hides it within the Room of Requirement. Considering the idea of the half-blood prince is in the title, I figured there should have been more resolve. I really did not see any of what happened in this book coming - it was the beginning of the end and I loved it. It was amazing to finally learn more about Snape and to be left doubting everything that I thought about him and the story in general before. I\\'m glad I read this when the seventh was already out, otherwise I may have died from anticipation :). Best book out of the series! It was (one of) my favorite HP movies as well so that was to be expected, but I think the book added a lot of depth to the story that the movie was maybe lacking a bit (even though the movie is very entertaining). Especially concerning Dumbledore\\'s death (this doesn\\'t need to be marked as a spoiler anymore, does it? XD Come on, you should know this by now) and Voldemort\\'s past. Everything just made more sense in the book and therefore the tension was more palpable. I loved how they develop romantic relationships in this book - makes it feel a lot more Young Adulty, which I like! Ron and Hermione <3 Also, book Ginny is so much more awesome than movie Ginny, it\\'s true. FIVE STARSSSS! Read (to Greg) Nov 2005 (Reread June 2016) Still 5 stars! I\\'ll make this review short. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince started with the conversation of the Minsiter of Magic with the Prime Minister of the muggle world (really, I loved this part. It\\'s hilarious haha!) and ended with a breathless moment in the history of Harry Potter series ;) Although the book kind-of focused on teenagers feelings of love, angst, care and whatsoever, it didn\\'t ruin the book because it lightened some of the sinister mood from previous HP series. I will leave this review with an utmost appreciation for Albus Dumbledore. I admire how his usual calm expression guides Harry into a world much darker. Harry\\'s clear dedication still fights with the idea that he could use his magic only for the good and absolutely not for evil. The Half Blood Prince has the best ending in the series so far. However, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Order of The Phoenix will still remain as my favorite HP series ever. :p We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on. -- Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'"
